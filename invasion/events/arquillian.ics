DESCRIPTION:\n				<p>This highly technical session examines solutions for
  easing the testing of some of the more complex use cases within Java EE
 . Each example is backed by a runnable test (publicly available to parti
 cipants)\, and the presentation covers automated continuous development 
 of:</p>\n<ul class="bullets">\n  <li>The Web user interface (via Seleniu
 m)</li>\n  <li>Persistent data and JPA</li>\n  <li>Transactional boundar
 ies</li>\n  <li>Cloud-based deployments</li>\n  <li>RESTful endpoints</l
 i>\n  <li>More</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It showcases various techniques outlined 
 in the book Continuous Enterprise Development in Java\, forthcoming from
  O’Reilly Media\, and is delivered by the authors. Expect a lot of pro
 of through open source demos. You&#39\;ll see the presenters exercise th
 e features of any compliant Java EE 6 runtime\, using the Arquillian pla
 tform.</p>\n

DESCRIPTION:\n				<p>The myth of Java EE as a cumbersome platform is one 
 we easily dispel in this session. Here we&#39\;ll create a working appli
 cation from a blank repository and push it to a live cloud deployment\, 
 in real time. During which time we&#39\;ll:</p>\n<ul class="bullets">\n 
  <li>Cover tooling to bootstrap project creation (Forge)\, freeing you f
 rom mucking around with Maven POM boilerplate</li>\n  <li>Generate a dom
 ain model and reverse-engineer JPA entities from it</li>\n  <li>Automati
 cally creates the scaffolding for tests that run in a real Java EE conta
 iner (Arquillian)\, launched from the IDE</li>\n  <li>Push it all to pro
 duction on a public site (OpenShift)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Using a variety of 
 projects from the JBoss Community adhering to and building upon open sta
 ndards\, this presentation can create real enterprise apps in the time i
 t takes other sessions to click through some slides. Let’s get buildin
 g!</p>\n

DESCRIPTION:\n				<p>Arquillian is a revolutionary testing platform for J
 ava and the JVM that enables developers to easily create and execute int
 egration and functional tests for Java middleware\, from Java EE and bey
 ond. One of Arquillianâ€™s strong points is its extensibility. Arqu
 illian was built with the ability to change its default behavior via its
  powerful extension model as well as to grow past its original programmi
 ng to take on the challenges of tomorrow. This presentation guides you t
 hrough the Arquillian extensions by demonstrating how specific extension
 s solve common problematic testing scenarios faced by enterprise develop
 ers. You will get a overview of what is available and possible today as 
 well as what is brewing in the community.</p>\n

DESCRIPTION:\n				<p>Apache TomEE is the Java EE 6 Web Profile certified 
 version of Apache Tomcat and combines the simplicity of Tomcat with the 
 power of Java EE. The first half of this session introduces TomEE and sh
 ows how Tomcat applications leveraging Java EE technologies can become s
 impler and lighter with a Java EE 6 certified solution built right on To
 mcat.</p>\n<p>The second half focuses on those already familiar with Tom
 EE and goes into detail on latest advancements\, testing techniques incl
 uding Arquillian\, clustering features and production considerations. If
  you&#39\;re a Tomcat lover or a TomEE enthusiast\, this is the session 
 you don&#39\;t want to miss!</p>\n
