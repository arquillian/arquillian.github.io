SUMMARY:JBoss\, show me the Java EE Way
DESCRIPTION:\n				\n					<p>2000 called\, it wants its bloatware back. No w
 here does the Java EE specification state that application servers and prog
 ramming models must be slow\, clunky and fat. At JBoss\, we decided it was 
 time to flip the switch on enterprise development and make it productive. I
 n this session\, we&#39\;ll show you how to build applications that are sli
 m\, fast and powerful. Ah\, but\, how many times have you wanted to start a
  new project in Java EE and struggled to pull the pieces together? You&#39\
 ;ll witness how JBoss Forge can incrementally assemble an application at yo
 ur command\, open it in the IDE for code-assist editing and deploy it to AS
  7. Pulling back the curtains\, we&#39\;ll reveal the speed of the new rend
 ition of our flagship project\, JBoss AS 7. We&#39\;ll dive into how this p
 erformance boost was achieved through a clever use of parallelism and concu
 rrency\, how the modular design saves you from classloader hell and why it&
 #39\;s such a pleasure to administer and test. It&#39\;s everything you&#39
 \;ve wanted in an application server. Then\, we&#39\;ll take you through th
 e Java EE Web Profile\, show you how it has redefined Java EE to mean &quot
 \;easy&quot\; and &quot\;extensible&quot\; and reassure you that you no lon
 ger have to fear testing it thanks to Arquillian. Finally\, we&#39\;ll take
  it to the cloud using git and the OpenShift deployment plugin in JBoss Too
 ls. In the end\, we&#39\;ll remind you that you&#39\;re doing all this with
  the &quot\;Enterprise Edition&quot\; of Java without any of the pain that 
 would seem to imply. Like we said\, we&#39\;ve got a new attitude. Come exp
 erience it.</p>\n				\n

SUMMARY:Arquillian - a fresh look at enterprise testing.
DESCRIPTION:\n				\n					<p>We all know that unit tests are great\, but rel
 ying only on them is most of the times just an illusion of safety. Eventual
 ly we need to verify how our components are interacting or whether running 
 in the target environment does not end up with some unexpected behaviour. L
 ast but not least it all amounts to whether your application is providing t
 he end user what he or she is really expecting.</p>\n\n<p>Not so long ago r
 unning in-container integration tests was a challenging task and required a
  well thought process as a part of the automated build. Nowadays we are equ
 ipped with a &quot\;Swiss Army knife&quot\; for almost any aspect of testin
 g. Along this journey in the world of testing we will take a closer look at
  Arquillian\, testing framework from JBoss\, which hides complexity of test
 ing Java EE applications by managing your runtime\, abstracting out deploym
 ent process and allowing you to focus on real test logic.</p>\n\n<p>I will 
 explain what Arquillian is\, how it can make our lives easier and bring bac
 k the fun in writing tests! We will also see that Arquillian ecosystem is w
 ay more than just integration testing. After looking at available extension
 s we will dive straight into UI testing so you can learn how to write funct
 ional tests in BDD manner using Groovy and Arquillian together with Seleniu
 m/WebDriver.</p>\n				\n

SUMMARY:Designing Top-Class Test Suites for Web Applications
DESCRIPTION:\n				\n					<p>The evolution which came with the Arquillian\, 
 award-winning integration test framework\, and Selenium\, outstanding tool 
 for UI automation\, allows to write high-quality tests. But these technolog
 ies can’t save the world by themselves\, since they are leaving too many 
 questions open:</p>\n\n<p>* Does Selenium cover everything? It covers page 
 transitions\, a simple JavaScript interaction and a portion of DOM. Is it r
 eally enough?<br />* Mocking requests for testing server-side code is pain.
  Is it necessary?<br />* Are you able to detect that your component’s vis
 ual representation changes?<br />* Does investigating these changes involve
  a disproportionate amount of effort?<br />* Isn’t manual test developmen
 t too expensive?</p>\n\n<p>What if you could fill all the above gaps?</p>\n
