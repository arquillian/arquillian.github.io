DESCRIPTION:\n				<p>The Persistence Layer is one of the most crucial par
 ts of enterprise applications\, and we use many different frameworks and
  patterns to keep it clean. We write sophisticated queries and use optim
 ization techniques to give our end users the greatest possible experienc
 e.</p>\n<p>So why is Persistence very often skipped in testing efforts? 
 Is it really that complex and painful to setup? The Arquillian Persisten
 ce Extension removes that burden and boilerplate to make you a happy and
  productive programmer again! Join this session and see for yourself tha
 t writing tests for your database logic is as easy as writing normal uni
 t tests! Don&#39\;t expect too many slides\, be prepared for live demo!<
