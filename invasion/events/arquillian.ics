DESCRIPTION:\n				<p>Unit tests are programmer&#39\;s best friend\, but r
 elying on them exclusively gives an illusion of overall system integrity
 . At some level\, we need to verify how our components integrate and ens
 ure unexpected behavior does not creep in when we shift the application 
 into the target runtime. It all amounts to whether your application is p
 roviding the end user what he or she is really needs (tire swing) instea
 d of what anyone thinks they need. How can we save our users from frustr
 ation\, keep the fail whale at bay and communicate with stakeholders tha
 t the requirements are being met?</p>\n<p>We&#39\;ll show you how the Ar
 quillian testing platform can give you these guarantees by driving agile
  development. We&#39\;ll explore the concepts of BDD and ATDD together u
 sing a powerful trio of testing frameworks: Arquillian\, WebDriver and T
 hucydides. Rather than just test cases\, you&#39\;ll build higher-level\
 , end-to-end functional behavior using reusable web test components and 
 following a clear &quot\;given\, when\, then&quot\; perspective. The res
 ult: cleaner\, clearer tests that both validate your requirements and do
 cument your system behavior.</p>\n<p>Testing behaviors has never been so
  easy\, and so real! If you care about quality of your software you defi
 nitely shouldn&#39\;t miss this talk!</p>\n

DESCRIPTION:\n				<p>Arquillian contributors channel their multi-language
  and multi-framework development exploits into an ongoing tale of worldw
 ide bug extermination. They answer Ike&#39\;s call to battle and help hi
 m discover untested code frontiers and create new tools to hunt and dest
 roy their common enemy\, bugs.</p>\n<p>Is this a science fiction story o
 r an open source project? It&#39\;s both. We all know there are thousand
 s of awesome and useful open source projects out there\, but finding the
 m and figuring out how to use them can be a disheartening journey with a
  tragic ending. Potential users don&#39\;t discover your project. Potent
 ial contributors don&#39\;t understand your project. Your unsung project
  dies.</p>\n<p>In this talk you&#39\;ll learn ways to connect with commu
 nity members\, how to help them get involved with the project\, and how 
 to encourage them to plot future project features and goals.</p>\n

DESCRIPTION:\n				<p>The myth of Java EE as a cumbersome platform is easi
 ly dispelled in this session\, which aims to create a working applicatio
 n\, from a blank repository to a live cloud deployment\, in real time. I
 t:</p>\n<p>• Covers tools that bootstrap project creation\, freeing yo
 u from mucking around with Maven POM boilerplate<br />\n* Generates a do
 main model and reverse-engineers JPA entities from it<br />\n* Automatic
 ally creates the scaffolding for tests that run in a real Java EE contai
 ner\, launched from the IDE<br />\n* Pushes it all to production on a pu
 blic site</p>\n<p>Using a variety of projects from the JBoss Community a
 dhering to and building upon open standards\, this presentation can crea
 te real enterprise apps in the time it takes other sessions to click thr
 ough some slides. Let’s get building!</p>\n

DESCRIPTION:\n				<p>Arquillian is a revolutionary testing platform for J
 ava and the JVM that enables developers to easily create and execute int
 egration and functional tests for Java middleware\, from Java EE and bey
 ond. One of Arquillian’s strong points is its extensibility. Arquillia
 n was built with the ability to change its default behavior via its powe
 rful extension model as well as to grow past its original programming to
  take on the challenges of tomorrow. This presentation guides you throug
 h the Arquillian extensions by demonstrating how specific extensions sol
 ve common problematic testing scenarios faced by enterprise developers. 
 You will get a overview of what is available and possible today as well 
 as what is brewing in the community.</p>\n

DESCRIPTION:\n				<p>This highly technical session examines solutions for
  easing the testing of some of the more complex use cases within Java EE
 . Each example is backed by a runnable test (publicly available to parti
 cipants)\, and the presentation covers automated continuous development 
 of:</p>\n<p>• The Web user interface (via Selenium)<br />\n• Persist
 ent data and JPA<br />\n• Transactional boundaries<br />\n• Cloud-ba
 sed deployments<br />\n• RESTful endpoints<br />\n• More</p>\n<p>It 
 showcases various techniques outlined in the book Continuous Enterprise 
 Development in Java\, forthcoming from O’Reilly Media\, and is deliver
 ed by the authors. Expect a lot of proof through open source demos. You&
 #39\;ll see the presenters exercise the features of any compliant Java E
 E 6 runtime\, using the Arquillian platform.</p>\n

DESCRIPTION:\n				<p>Using a Web application is easy. Testing it should b
 e easy as well. Arquillian\, a revolutionary Java enterprise testing pla
 tform—together with its extensions Arquillian Drone and Arquillian And
 roid—enables that. In this tutorial\, you will learn how to integrate 
 existing testing frameworks such as JUnit with the Web testing tool Sele
 nium. It also leverages the Maven infrastructure of a project. Whatever 
 technology you are using to create Web pages\, wherever the application 
 is deployed\, and whatever browser—including mobile ones—you are usi
 ng\, configuring a test environment is a matter of minutes. Do not spend
  time with configuration\; skip right to writing Web tests.</p>\n

DESCRIPTION:\n				<p>In modern development environments\, it’s a must t
 o include testing of Web applications as a standard part of the developm
 ent lifecycle. Such tests can also be used as acceptance criteria in ent
 erprise projects. Although full automation is possible\, it is considere
 d to be very expensive. As a result\, in projects where testing is inclu
 ded as part of the project plan\, it is also often the first requirement
  cut when the project schedule begins to slip. Learn more in this sessio
 n.</p>\n
