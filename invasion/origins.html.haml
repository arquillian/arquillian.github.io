  Arquillian originated from the "JBoss Test Harness":http://docs.jboss.org/cdi/tck/reference/1.0.1-Final/html/test-harness.html, a utility created by "Pete Muir":profile://petemuir as the foundation of the "JSR-299":http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=299 (CDI 1.0) and "JSR-303":http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=303 (Bean Validation 1.0) TCKs. This work established the guiding principles of Arquillian:

  * Tests should be reusable in any container (because executing tests in a full Java EE container is expensive)
  * Tests should run easily from an IDE (to make debugging easy)
  * The framework should be built on existing unit testing frameworks to allow reuse of existing tools (to foster a testing ecosystem)
  
  The JBoss Test Harness prototyped a solution that provided:
  
  - Declarative, annotation driven assembly of archives := The archive mechanism is needed to allow easy execution from the IDE, without having to call out to a slow and cumbersome build script. In Arquillian this responsibility was delegated to "ShrinkWrap":http://jboss.org/shrinkwrap, a fluent Java API for assembling archives such as JARs, WARs and EARs in Java.
  - A Java Adapter API which could start/stop a container and deploy a test := The container adapters are needed to allow running inside an IDE, and also allow a test to be reused in multiple environments.
  - Easy switching between in-container and standalone mode := Arquillian abstracted this concept away from the test case, and instead treats in-container and standalone tests as different types of containers.
  - Packaging of the test case alongside the archive := The test and infrastructure is relocated to the server where it is executed by TestNG when running in-container.
  - A pluggable test executor := Allows the framework to select incontainer execution or standalone execution for the same test.
  
  It quickly became obvious that this was something that could be really useful to other people outside of the CDI TCK and Bean Validation TCKs. As Pete had hacked the JBoss Test Harness together in 3 weeks, it was obviously better to take just the ideas and start afresh. At the time, work on Java EE 6 was reaching a crucial point, so this project was put on the backburner until late-2009, when Aslak popped up and quickly picked up the key ideas creating a clean, pluggable architecture, added JUnit support and test enrichment. Obviously we had to hire him!
  
  Since then, support has been added for additional containers, more sophisticated test enrichment and other test framework integrations. Arquillian was put to use immediately as the foundation of the test suites in the "Seam 3":http://sfwk.org/Seam3 modules and examples. It is also being adopted as a replacement for the "JSR-346":http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=299 (CDI 1.1) to replace the JBoss Test Harness. In other words, it's quickly becoming a standard for testing in the Java platform.

  Arquillian is part of the JBoss Testing initiative, an effort to unify the testing-related projects in the JBoss Community and beyond to provide a comprehensive testing tool set for application developers. It brings developers in the JBoss Community who are passionate about testing together so that we can all get on the same page. The initiative is led by the JBoss Testing Guide, Aslak Knutsen, Dan Allen and Andrew Rubinger. We kicked it off by establishing the "#jbosstesting":#{site.irc_transcripts} IRC channel on Freenode.net, where we continue to evolve the alignment of testing tools and strategies in the JBoss Community.

  Significant contributions to Arquillian have come from the Quality Engineering (QE) team at Red Hat. This team is focused on performing Quality Assurance (QA) for various JBoss projects in preparation for their inclusion in the JBoss Enterprise Platform. They have aligned their work with the JBoss Testing Initiative and have, as a result, merged the test frameworks they've developed into the Arquillian project. Notable contributions include Drone and Ajocado.
  
  The artwork for Arquillian was created by "Cheyenne Weaver":profile://cheyenneweaver over many long months of creative deliberation with the project team. The story of Ike and his bug fighting team has evolved thanks to the work of community member and content strategist "Sarah White":profile://graphitefriction.

  The project name may or may not be related to the alien species from a popular movie about protecting the Earth from alien scum. We just want to protect you from infrastructure scum in your integration tests. _Death to all bugs!_
