h3. Some of the highlights in this release

p. *Container Control modes* - Containers can now be configured to have multiple different control modes using the new ~mode~ attribute in ~arquillian.xml~

bc(prettify). <container qualifier="X" mode="suite|class|manual" />

* suite (default)
  As you know it from before, container will be started and stopped as part of the test suite.

* class
  The container will be started and stopped for each TestClass

* manual
  Control the lifecycle by injecting @ArquillianResource ContainerController and calling cc.start|stop|kill from within your TestMethods. In manual mode, the container will be automatically stopped in @AfterClass.

bc(prettify).. @ArquillianResource ContainerController controller;

@Test
public void shouldBeAbleTo() throws Exception
{
  // do stuff
  controller.start("qualifier");

  // do stuff
  controller.kill("qualifier");

  controller.start("qualifier", new Config("some-new-container-option", "value"));
  // do stuff
}


p. *Ordering of JUnit TestMethods* - As pr the JVM specification, the order of Methods in a Class are not tied to the order they are written in the source file. You can now annotated your TestMethods with @InSequence(n) to run them in a defined order.

p. Support for *TestNG* >= 6.3
