            <div class="body">
              <p>Last month, the <a href="http://jboss.org/arquillian">Arquillian</a> developers got together at <a href="http://www.redhat.com/summit">Red Hat Summit / JBossWorld 2010</a>, hosted at the Seaport World Trade Center in Boston, to Experience Open Source with our community.</p>
              <p><img src="/images/blog/redhatsummit2010/conference-entrance.jpg" title="Conference entrance" alt="Conference entrance" /></p>
              <p>We <a href="http://community.jboss.org/message/532470#532470">asked the community</a> what they wanted to hear about at <a href="http://jboss.org/events/JUDCon.html">JUDCon</a>. Survey said&#8230;&#8220;Arquillian.&#8221; So we unleashed Ike and his fleet of testable containers onto JUDCon and JBoss World.</p>
              <p>While Arquillian only appeared twice on the official schedule&#8212;once at JUDCon, presented by Aslak and myself, and once at JBoss World, presented by ALR&#8212;it managed to make an appearance every hour, in one form or another (including bar discussions). Thanks for encouraging him with all the votes!</p>
              <p>On the eve of JUDCon, three of the Arquillian ringleaders (<a href="https://community.jboss.org/people/aslak">Aslak</a>, <a href="https://community.jboss.org/people/alrubinger">ALR</a> and <a href="https://community.jboss.org/people/dan.j.allen">Dan</a>) met up at Harvard Square bar for the Boston JBUG to devise a plan to make testing a main focal point of the weeklong conference event:</p>
              <p><img src="/images/blog/judcon2010/arquillian-ringleader-meeting.jpg" title="Arquillian team meetup" alt="Arquillian team meetup" /></p>
              <p>Not letting a moment slip by, Arquillian led off the <a href="http://jboss.org/events/JUDCon/schedule.html">community track</a> at JUDCon early the next morning.</p>
              <p><img src="/images/blog/judcon2010/community-track.jpg" title="JUDCon 2010 Community Track" alt="JUDCon 2010 Community Track" /></p>
              <p>Aslak and I wanted to leave a strong impression on the audience. So instead of going on about theory, we prepared a talk on <a href="https://jboss.org/dms/judcon/presentations/JUDCon2010_FutureofJavaEETesting.pdf">the future of Java EE testing</a> that can be summed up as: <a href="http://github.com/arquillian/arquillian-showcase">demo, demo, demo, demo</a>. With me driving the commands (doing my best to type on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_layout#Norwegian">Norwegian keyboard layout</a>), Aslak pointed at the screen and, in a flash, showed how Arquillian can make child&#8217;s play out of testing EJBs, JMS, JAX-RS, JPA and even JSF.</p>
              <p><img src="/images/blog/judcon2010/aslak-presenting-arquillian-test_scaled.jpg" title="Aslak explaining an Arquillian test" alt="Aslak explaining an Arquillian test" /></p>
              <p>While we&#8217;ve come a long way with Arquillian, presenting always gets us thinking of other things we can do with it. (Notice Aslak sporting the <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/jbossorg.457236901">black Arquillian shirt</a>).</p>
              <p><img src="/images/blog/judcon2010/aslak-pondering-question.jpg" title="Aslak answering a question" alt="Aslak answering a question" /></p>
              <p>Ike didn&#8217;t want to get stuck inside the computer the whole conference, so we printed him on a bunch of <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/jbossorg/7125835">shirts and buttons</a> to give away. Our plan was almost foiled because of my absentmindedness, but it was saved when my wife delivered the &#8220;bag of goodies&#8221; just as the talk was ending. We spread the Arquillian swag around and it scattered off to invade other talks and strike up conversations.</p>
              <p><img src="/images/blog/judcon2010/dan-tossing-t-shirts.jpg" title="Dan tossing t-shirts" alt="Dan tossing t-shirts" /></p>
              <p>Everytime you turned around, Ike was hitching a ride on someone&#8217;s backpack.</p>
              <p><img src="/images/blog/judcon2010/ike-riding-on-backpack.jpg" title="Ike pin on backpack" alt="Ike pin on backpack" /></p>
              <p>Making his second apparence on the <a href="http://asylum.libsyn.com/">JBoss Community Asylum</a>, this time under the JBoss moniker, Aslak explained how Arquillian makes the task of testing Java EE applications simple and possible. This would be one of many trips to the microphone throughout the week. But this time, he caught some grief from the jokester hosts poking fun at the project name:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Who is Hark William? Is he a country singer or some sort of character from Star Wars?</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Aslak set the record straight.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>His name is Ike. And he&#8217;s from Hollywood. He&#8217;s an alien that controls everything inside his little world.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><img src="/images/blog/arquillian_icon_64px.png" class="graphic" title="Arquillian icon" alt="Arquillian icon" /></p>
              <p>If Ike could speak, he would have simply issued the warning:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Don&#8217;t mock me.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>He must have left quite an impression, because the host immediately credited Arquillian as having &#8220;a couple of talks today.&#8221; Sure, that&#8217;s how we remember it too</p>
              <p>Even though the Arquillian team only had one talk at JUDCon, we did have a front row seat in the <a href="https://jboss.org/dms/judcon/presentations/JUDCon2010_JCAConnectingEnterprise.pdf">Code generation world premiere</a> presented by <a href="https://community.jboss.org/people/jesper.pedersen">Jesper Pedersen</a> from the <a href="http://jboss.org/ironjacamar" title="JBoss JCA">IronJacamar</a> Team, showing of their shiny new tool for JCA adaptor source code generation with full Arquillian test support.</p>
              <p>So what&#8217;s the Arquillian project status? &#8220;Alpha3 is coming soon. And more containers.&#8221; (Little did they know, three containers would be added later that night).</p>
              <p>The podcast had interrupted the JUDCon hackfest. It then proceeded to ultimately disrupt the hackfest when Emmanuel announced at the top of the hour,</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Let&#8217;s go get some beers.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>So all the talk of a hackfest ended up being just that, talk. But wait, not those hard-core Arquillian developers. They&#8217;re the only ones that stuck around, pressing on even in the absense of beer.</p>
              <p><img src="/images/blog/judcon2010/arquillian-hackfest.jpg" title="Arquillian hackfest" alt="Arquillian hackfest" /></p>
              <p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; you ask. Because we were hell-bent on getting the Tomcat and Jetty container integrations working. I did the Jetty integration while <a href="https://community.jboss.org/people/deruelle_jean">Jean Deruelle</a> worked on the one for Tomcat. <a href="https://community.jboss.org/people/lincolnthree">Lincoln Baxter III</a> looked up from his work laying down the foundation for <a href="http://jboss.org/forge">JBoss Forge</a>.</p>
              <p><img src="/images/blog/judcon2010/arquillian-hackfest-intense.jpg" title="Developers looking at screen" alt="Developers looking at screen" /></p>
              <p>Once we both got green bars, we finally called it a night and headed out for a round of drinks to celebrate.</p>
              <p><img src="/images/blog/judcon2010/drinking-at-whiskey-priest.jpg" title="Drinks at Whiskey Priest" alt="Drinks at Whiskey Priest" /></p>
              <p>We took a break the next afternoon to check out the sights and sounds of downtown Boston, which could be seen off in the distance from the conference center.</p>
              <p><img src="/images/blog/redhatsummit2010/downtown-boston.jpg" title="Boston skyscape" alt="Boston skyscape" /></p>
              <p>That evening I headed over to the Red Hat Summit kickoff at the pavilion for my booth duty. <a href="https://community.jboss.org/people/kenglxn">Ken Gullaksen</a>, one of our top community members, snapped a shot of me sporting our cool <a href="https://jboss.org/coolstuff/desktopwallpapers/arquillian.html">Arquillian desktop wallpaper</a> on my Android phone.</p>
              <p><img src="/images/blog/redhatsummit2010/arquillian-android-background.jpg" title="Arquillian desktop wallpaper on Android" alt="Arquillian desktop wallpaper on Android" /></p>
              <p>Fashioning the Arquillian button, I was soon approached by an attendee who asked me if I had any extra. I asked him if he knew what they were for. He replied,</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>No. But it looks really cool.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Ike, such a developer magnet <img src="/images/emoticons/wink.png" alt=";)" class="emoticon" /></p>
              <p>At some point we made our way from the conference center to a bar downtown. Like always, I&#8217;m in the bar ranting on about some technology, probably Maven:</p>
              <p><img src="/images/blog/redhatsummit2010/dan-ranting-at-bar.jpg" title="Dan ranting at bar" alt="Dan ranting at bar" /></p>
              <p>We were up early the next morning for the second Arquillian charge. ALR kicked off the conference by showing how developers can achieve rapid development with Enterprise Java by <a href="http://www.redhat.com/promo/summit/2010/presentations/jbossworld/developer-insights-ii/wed/arubginer-1020-throwing/arubinger_1020_throwing.pdf">throwing complexity over the wall</a> and using ShrinkWrap and Arquillian, while at the same time <a href="https://community.jboss.org/people/marklittle">Mark Little</a>, our director, was in the other room explaining how Arquillian fits into our strategy in his <a href="http://www.redhat.com/promo/summit/2010/presentations/jbossworld/enterprise-insights/wed/mlittle-1020-state/mlittle_1020_jboss_state.pdf">JBoss State of the Union address</a>.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Arquillian is <strong>central</strong> to the evolution of platfoms &amp; relevant for development.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>To put it more bluntly, he slipped out,</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><strong>You need to test the hell out of things.</strong></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>We agree <img src="/images/emoticons/smile.png" alt=":)" class="emoticon" /></p>
              <p>Handling all that complexity for the developer is hard work, though. It really took it&#8217;s toll on ALR,</p>
              <p><img src="/images/blog/redhatsummit2010/alr-passed-out.jpg" title="ALR passed out on couch" alt="ALR passed out on couch" /></p>
              <p>Arquillian got a mention in the joint <a href="http://www.redhat.com/promo/summit/2010/sessions/jboss.html#580123">RichFaces 4 / Seam Faces</a> talk and the <a href="http://www.redhat.com/promo/summit/2010/sessions/jboss.html#546873">Seam 3: State of Union</a> talk. All the activity had the developers&#8217; interest piqued. When <a href="https://community.jboss.org/people/petemuir">Pete Muir</a> asked during the the <a href="http://www.redhat.com/promo/summit/2010/sessions/jboss.html#523000">JBoss Developer Story BOF</a> what people wanted to hear more about, someone called out,</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>I want to hear more about the testing tool.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Once again, Aslak was called to the mic to showcase Arquillian. The timing was excellent because <a href="https://community.jboss.org/people/burrsutter">Burr Sutter</a>, who is currently focused on improving the developer experience, witnessed first-hand how desperately this tool is needed. Afterwards, I said to him,</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>It&#8217;s like we just showed up with food to a starving country.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>And what are they asking for? <strong>More.</strong></p>
              <p>Until we meet up again, we&#8217;ll be hard at work making testing as easy and powerful as possible. That means working closely with our tools guy, <a href="https://community.jboss.org/people/maxandersen">Max Andersen</a> (left).</p>
              <p><img src="/images/blog/redhatsummit2010/max-aslak-alr.jpg" title="Max, Aslak and ALR" alt="Max, Aslak and ALR" /></p>
              <p>Ike sure had a big week. So at the end of it all, we bought him a drink (at Drink).</p>
              <p><img src="/images/blog/redhatsummit2010/arquillian-drink.jpg" title="Arquillian t-shirt with drink" alt="Arquillian t-shirt with drink" /></p>
              <p>The <a href="http://community.jboss.org/community/arquillian">Arquillian forums</a> are really heating up! Community participation is what makes the success of Arquillian possible. Keep it up folks!</p>

            <div class="body">
              <p>I&#8217;m happy to announce the first alpha release of <a href="http://arquillian.org">Arquillian</a>, an open source (<a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">ASL v2</a>) framework for running tests in the container. If you want to read more about Arquillian&#8217;s mission and how it fits into our vision for testing at JBoss, read Pete&#8217;s companion blog entry, <a href="/blog/2010/03/10/testing-javaee-the-jboss-way">Testing Java EE the JBoss way</a>.</p>
              <p>It&#8217;s one thing to unit test your code outside of the container, but what happens when you run it inside? Does it still behave the same? How about testing against container managed resources? This is where Arquillian comes into its own.</p>
              <p>With Arquillian it&#8217;s just as easy to write integration tests as it is to write unit tests. In fact, to minimize the burden on you, Arquillian integrates with familiar testing frameworks, allowing reuse of tools such as the JUnit/TestNG support in your favorite IDE, Maven Surefire, Ant &#8211; in fact any tool which supports TestNG or JUnit!</p>
              <p>To show you just how simple this is, here&#8217;s an example test case setup using JUnit (we&#8217;ll get to the actual test next):</p>
              <pre class="prettify"><code class="prettify">@RunWith(org.jboss.arquillian.junit.Arquillian.class)&#x000A;public class TemperatureConverterTestCase {</code>&#x000A; &#x000A;<code class="prettify">    @Deployment&#x000A;    public static JavaArchive createTestArchive() {&#x000A;        return Archives.create("test.jar", JavaArchive.class)&#x000A;            .addClasses(TemperatureConverter.class, TemperatureConverterBean.class);&#x000A;    }</code>&#x000A; &#x000A;<code class="prettify">}</code></pre>
              <p>By using JUnit&#8217;s <code>@RunWith</code> annotation, you tell JUnit to use Arquillian as the test controller. Arquillian will then look for a static method marked with the <code>@Deployment</code> annotation, which defines your micro-deployment. In the example above, the micro-deployment contains a session bean interface and implementation, which Arquillian will deploy to the container.</p>
              <p>Arquillian hooks into your testing frameworks lifecycle and reacts to events. On the before suite and after suite events the container is started/stopped, while on the before class and after class events your micro-deployment is deployed to/undeployed from the container.</p>
              <p>The test case is started in the local JVM. Arquillian then overrides the normal test execution and migrates the test so that it&#8217;s executed inside the container. By the time the test framework calls your <code>@Test</code> annotated method, the test is running inside the container, giving us the possibility to work with container managed resources. Here&#8217;s the complete test class with JUnit <code>@Test</code> methods.</p>
              <pre class="prettify"><code class="prettify">@RunWith(org.jboss.arquillian.junit.Arquillian.class)&#x000A;public class TemperatureConverterTestCase {</code>&#x000A; &#x000A;<code class="prettify">    @Deployment&#x000A;    public static JavaArchive createTestArchive() {&#x000A;        return Archives.create("test.jar", JavaArchive.class)&#x000A;            .addClasses(TemperatureConverter.class, TemperatureConverterBean.class);&#x000A;    }</code>&#x000A; &#x000A;<code class="prettify">    @EJB&#x000A;    TemperatureConverter converter;</code>&#x000A; &#x000A;<code class="prettify">    @Test&#x000A;    public void shouldConvertToCelsius() {&#x000A;        Assert.assertEquals(converter.convertToCelsius(32d), 0d);&#x000A;        Assert.assertEquals(converter.convertToCelsius(212d), 100d);&#x000A;    }</code>&#x000A; &#x000A;<code class="prettify">    @Test&#x000A;    public void shouldConvertToFarenheit() {&#x000A;        Assert.assertEquals(converter.convertToFarenheit(0d), 32d);&#x000A;        Assert.assertEquals(converter.convertToFarenheit(100d), 212d);&#x000A;    }&#x000A;}</code></pre>
              <p>Note how we can use <code>@EJB</code> to inject the session bean from our deployment into the test case for use in our test method &#8211; <em>neat!</em></p>
              <p>The Arquillian TestEnricher SPI supports all the injection annotations from Java EE 6:</p>
              <ul>
              	<li><code>@EJB</code></li>
              	<li><code>@Resource</code></li>
              	<li><code>@PersistenceContext</code></li>
              	<li><code>@Inject</code></li>
              </ul>
              <p>Since there are no container specific code/configuration in this example test case, it&#8217;s portable. That means it can be run in GlassFish, JBoss AS or OpenEJB, <em>or all three!</em> The choice is yours.</p>

              <h2>So, what&#8217;s next?</h2>
              <p>Some of the things you can expect from Arquillian in the future are:</p>
              <ul>
              	<li><b>Local run mode</b> &#8212; Sometimes, you don&#8217;t want to run the test case inside the container itself. A local run mode will be added; a mode where your test controls the deployment but is not deployed as a part of it. This will give you the chance to run a test against, for example, JSF pages or RMI (testing for those nasty Non-Serializable / SessionClosed exceptions).</li>
              	<li><b>Multiple deployments controlled by same test</b> &#8212; Sometimes your micro-deployment is not enough to test on its own and you want to package other components as part of the same deployment. For example, you need to test the interaction between two Web applications.</li>
              	<li><b>Support for method argument injection</b> &#8212; In the first alpha we only support field injection. In alpha 2 we will be extending the <a href="http://docs.jboss.org/arquillian/spi/1.0.0.Alpha1/org/jboss/arquillian/spi/TestEnricher.html">TestEnricher SPI</a> to include support for method argument injection:</li>
              </ul>
              <pre class="prettify"><code class="prettify">@Test&#x000A;public void shouldWithdrawFromAccount(@EJB AccountManager manager)&#x000A;        throws Exception {&#x000A;    ...&#x000A;}</code></pre>
              <ul>
              	<li><b>Test method interceptors</b> &#8211; Another planned enricher SPI is a test method interceptor. With this we can add support for transactions:</li>
              </ul>
              <pre class="prettify"><code class="prettify">@Test&#x000A;@TransactionAttribute(TransactionAttributeType.REQUIRES_NEW)&#x000A;public void shouldWithdrawFromAccount(@EJB AccountManager manager)&#x000A;        throws Exception {&#x000A;    ...&#x000A;}</code></pre>
              <ul>
              	<li><b>Convention over configuration</b> &#8211; The micro-deployments should be as easy as possible to create, so adding support for common conventions should help speed up the test development. For example we can automatically add all classes in the same package as the test class to the deployment</li>
              	<li><b>Arquillian controlled resources</b> &#8211; Sometimes the container requires container specific configuration e.g, <code>java.naming.*</code> parameters needed to create an <code>InitialContext</code>. If the test case has to explicitly deal with this, it places the burden for container portability back on the test case author. Arquillian will provide an extension point to add Arquillian created/managed resources:</li>
              </ul>
              <pre class="prettify"><code class="prettify">// auto creation of InitialContext based on running container, remote or local.&#x000A;@ArquillianResource&#x000A;InitialContext context;</code></pre>
              <pre class="prettify"><code class="prettify">// auto creation of URL to a deployed Servlet, including http port/ip etc.&#x000A;@ArquillianResource(MyServlet.class)&#x000A;URL myServletURL;</code></pre>
              <pre class="prettify"><code class="prettify">// the bundle context of a deployed osgi bundle&#x000A;@ArquillianResource&#x000A;BundleContext context;</code></pre>
              <ul>
              	<li><b>Support for more containers</b> &#8211; We will plan to support more containers! Currently we have planned: GlassFish 3 (as a remote container), Jetty, Tomcat, Resin, Felix OSGI. (Hey Spring guys, you&#8217;re welcome to join in too!)</li>
              	<li><b>Third party integrations</b> &#8211; In the spirit of ease of development, we integrate with existing test frameworks as much as possible, but we are always keen to learn of new frameworks we can integrate with. We already plan to support Selenium for example.</li>
              	<li><b>Support for other build tools</b> &#8211; Arquillian Alpha1 comes with Maven support. In upcoming releases, we will distribute builds targeted toward other build tools like Ant and Gradle (that shout out is for our resident Gradle expert, Jason Porter).</li>
              	<li><b>A project page, logo and artwork</b> &#8211; All good things must look good. That&#8217;s why the JBoss.org design team is hard at work putting together artwork for the Arquillian project page. Stay tuned!</li>
              </ul>
              <h2>Where can I see Arquillian in use?</h2>
              <p>Arquillian is a new framework, but it&#8217;s going to be put right to work as the workhorse to test all the Seam 3 modules. It will also be our recommended solution for testing your Seam application. (We&#8217;d love to see the community try it out for testing Seam 2 applications). We&#8217;ll also replace the current core of the JSR-299 CDI TCK with Arquillian, likely for the 1.1 version of the TCK. (To provide a little history, Arquillian originated from the <a href="http://docs.jboss.org/cdi/tck/reference/1.0.1-Final/html/test-harness-introduction.html">JBoss Test Harness</a> that was developed by Pete Muir as the foundation of the CDI TCK).</p>
              <p>If you have any thoughts on these ideas, or would like to suggest some new avenues we should explore, please contact us on the <a href="http://community.jboss.org/community/arquillian/dev">Arquillian Dev forum</a>.</p>
              <h2>And, what&#8217;s open source with out the community?!</h2>
              <p>A big thanks to the Arquillian and ShrinkWrap community for helping out on this release by being early adopters, joining in on <a href="http://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-14808">community meetings</a>, general discussions and writing blogs, articles and patches.

            <div class="body">
              <p>Recently, we&#8217;ve been working hard on a solution to improve the testability of <a href="http://in.relation.to/Bloggers/YouShouldUpgradeToJavaEE6">Java EE</a>, and particularly <a href="http://www.jboss.org/jbossas/">JBoss AS</a>. I&#8217;m pleased to say that a critical piece of puzzle, <a href="http://arquillian.org">Arqullian</a>, is now available. Congratulations to <a href="https://community.jboss.org/people/aslak">Aslak</a> and the Arquillian team for releasing the first alpha of Arquillian! You can read more about Arquillian&#8217;s mission, and our plans for Java EE testing below; alternatively, there are some quick links at the bottom if you want to dive right in.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>The mission of the Arquillian project is to provide a simple test harness that developers can use to produce a broad range of integration tests for their Java applications (most likely enterprise applications). A test case may be executed within the container, deployed alongside the code under test, or by coordinating with the container, acting as a client to the deployed code.</p>
              <p>Arquillian defines two styles of container, remote and embedded. A remote container resides in a separate JVM from the test runner. Its lifecycle may be managed by Arquillian, or Arquillian may bind to a container that is already started. An embedded container resides in the same JVM and is mostly likely managed by Arquillian. Containers can be further classified by their capabilities. Examples include a fully compliant Java EE application server (e.g., GlassFish, JBoss AS, Embedded GlassFish), a Servlet container (e.g., Tomcat, Jetty) and a bean container (e.g., Weld SE). Arquillian ensures that the container used for testing is pluggable, so the developer is not locked into a proprietary testing environment.</p>
              <p>Arquillian seeks to minimize the burden on the developer to carry out integration testing by handling all aspects of test execution, including:</p>
              <p /><ul><li>managing the lifecycle of the container (start/stop),</li><li>bundling the test class with dependent classes and resources into a deployable archive,</li><li>enhancing the test class (e.g., resolving @Inject, @EJB and @Resource injections),</li><li>deploying the archive to test (deploy/undeploy) and</li><li>capturing results and failures.</li></ul>
              <p>To avoid introducing unnecessary complexity into the developer&#8217;s build environment, Arquillian integrates transparently with familiar testing frameworks (e.g., JUnit 4, TestNG 5), allowing tests to be launched using existing IDE, Ant and Maven test plugins without any add-ons.</p>
              <p><em><strong style="text-align: right; display: block; color: #555;">The Arquillian Mission Statement</strong></em></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>The first alpha release of Arquillian gives us support for <a href="http://www.jboss.org/jbossas/">JBoss AS</a> (remote deployments), <a href="http://glassfish.dev.java.net/">GlassFish</a> (embedded deployments), <a href="https://docs.jboss.org/weld/reference/1.0.0/en-US/html/environments.html#d0e5064">Weld SE</a> (embedded deployments) and <a href="http://openejb.apache.org/">OpenEJB</a> (embedded deployments). You can also inject beans and component (using <code>@Resource</code> or <code>@Inject</code>) into test cases.</p>
              <p>We&#8217;ll be adding supported containers in future releases &#8211; if you want to see your favorite container on the list, <a href="http://community.jboss.org/en/arquillian">join our community</a> and we can show you how to add support for it. We also plan to add more convention over configuration, meaning you&#8217;ll only need to specify a single deployment and reuse it in all your test cases. Aslak has written more about future ideas in a <a href="/blog/2010/03/11/arquillian-1-alpha-1-released">follow-up blog entry</a> announcing the 1.0.0 Alpha 1 release. In that entry he also provides some examples of how to use Arquillian.</p>
              <p>We&#8217;re strong believers in writing tests, and writing tests which actually test your business logic in the environment it will finally run in, rather than introducing mocked out objects (which may behave differently). While unit testing is important to ensure the correctness of your logic, it does not ensure the correctness of two objects which interact with each other.</p>
              <p>With the help of the <a href="http://jboss.org/shrinkwrap">ShrinkWrap</a> project, Arquillian gives you the ability to create micro-deployments around your tests. Micro-deployments are contained sub-sections of your application logic. This gives you the ability to do lower level integration testing on a lower level then normal integration. It is up to you at what level you want to test!</p>
              <p>We also know you need a convenient way to run your test quickly, and that is why we are getting <a href="http://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-13843">JBoss Embedded AS</a> in shape. Embedded AS offers the potential to bootstrap JBoss AS inside the same JVM when you run your test, making it super easy to debug the test. Unfortunately, Embedded AS support didn&#8217;t make this release (we made a decision to release what we have now, rather than delay), but we will push this out to you as soon as it&#8217;s ready.</p>
              <p>Testing your components and services gets you a long way, but you&#8217;ll nearly always want to test your presentation tier as well. And that&#8217;s where frameworks like <a href="http://www.jboss.org/jsfunit">JSFUnit</a> and <a href="http://seleniumhq.org/">Selenium</a> come in &#8211; they allow you to exercise the work flows your user will use. Support for both these frameworks is planned, as well as for <a href="http://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-14882">Mock JSF Objects</a>.</p>
              <p>If you like what you&#8217;ve heard so far, but are worried that Arquillian requires build script wizardry to use, let us surprise you again! Being able to run any of these tests from within the IDE is a key goal of Arquillian &#8212; and the key to a rapid development cycle. Arquillian requires no build wizardry! So check out the <a href="http://docs.jboss.org/arquillian/reference/1.0.0.Alpha1/en-US/html_single">documentation</a> and give it a try today!</p>
