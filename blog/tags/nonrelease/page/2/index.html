              <p>It&#8217;s no suprise we&#8217;re obsessed with testing here in the Arquillian Galaxy. We&#8217;re eternally interested in sharpening our testing weapons, learning about tools that advance the frontline against the bugs, and discovering all the deep, dark code caves where bugs try to hide from testers.</p>
              <p>This year, <a href="http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV12/Home">Devoxx</a>, one of the premier Java developer conferences, is bringing together a large group of testing experts.

              <h3>To ATDD and Beyond! Better Automated Acceptance Testing on the JVM</h3>
              <p class="speakers"><a href="http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV12/John+Smart">John Smart</a>, University</p>
              <p>Test Driven Development is a game changer for developers, but Automated Acceptance Testing (ATDD) is a game changer for the whole team! More than just a testing technique, Automated Acceptance Testing is both a collaboration tool and a vital step on the road to Continuous Delivery. In this talk, you will see a real-world demo applying practical ATDD techniques to real-world projects using JBehave, Selenium 2 and Thucydides. <a href="http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV12/To+ATDD+and+beyond%21+Better+Automated+Acceptance+Testing+on+the+JVM">More &raquo;</a></p>

              <p>We all know JUnit rulez. But do you know JUnit Rules? Rules are a not so well known feature of JUnit. They allow us to encapsulate setup and teardown in a reusable package. You can manipulate the way tests get executed as well. <a href="http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV12/JUnit+Rules">More &raquo;</a></p>

              <h3>Testing Java Persistence Layer Done Right with Arquillian</h3>
              <p class="speakers"><a href="http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV12/Bartosz+Majsak">Bartosz Majsak</a>, Quickie</p>
              <p>The Persistence Layer is one of the most crucial parts of enterprise applications, and we use many different frameworks and patterns to keep it clean. We write sophisticated queries and use optimization techniques to give our end users the greatest possible experience. So why is Persistence very often skipped in testing efforts? Is it really that complex and painful to setup? The Arquillian Persistence Extension removes that burden and boilerplate to make you a happy and productive programmer again. <a href="http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV12/Testing+Java+Persistence+Layer+Done+Right+with+Arquillian">More &raquo;</a></p>

              <p>Behavior Driven Development (BDD) is an increasingly popular variation on Test Driven Development, which helps developers think more about what they are testing, in terms of &#8220;executable specifications&#8221; rather than conventional tests. But there are dozens of BDD tools for the JVM out there: how do you know what to use, and when? <a href="http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV12/Behaviour+Driven+Development+on+the+JVM+-+a+State+of+the+Union">More &raquo;</a></p>

              <p>Today it&#8217;s easy to expose services as REST/HTTP with frameworks like Jersey and Spring but validating that the server actually behaves as expected can be cumbersome in Java. REST Assured is an open source Java DSL that allows you to avoid boiler-plate code to make requests and validate even complex responses in a simple manner. <a href="http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV12/Do+you+REST+Assured">More &raquo;</a></p>

              <p class="speakers"><a href="http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV12/Wouter+Groeneveld">Wouter Groeneveld</a>, Conference</p>
              <p>Unit testing has become very popular with the rise of test-first software development. Most enterprise applications contain only a small portion of javascript code, almost always completely untested. We have seen a steady increase of javascript code and frameworks lately, but for most people it&#8217;s still unclear how to (unit) test javascript, and most of all how to properly integrate these within your build environment next to other JUnit test cases. <a href="http://www.devoxx.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=6391754">More &raquo;</a></p>

              <p>Apache TomEE is the Java EE 6 Web Profile certified version of Apache Tomcat and combines the simplicity of Tomcat with the power of Java EE. The first half of this session introduces TomEE and shows how Tomcat applications leveraging Java EE technologies can become simpler and lighter with a Java EE 6 certified solution built right on Tomcat. <a href="http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV12/Apache+TomEE%2C+Java+EE+6+Web+Profile+on+Tomcat">More &raquo;</a></p>

              <p class="speakers"><a href="http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV12/Andres+Almiray">Andres Almiray</a>, Quickie</p>
              <p>Testing, testing, testing. We all know it has to be done but no one likes to do it. Enter Spock, a revolutionary way to writing (and thinking about) test code, that promises to wash away the pain and bring back the fun. <a href="http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV12/Spock++boldly+go+where+no+test+has+gone+before">More &raquo;</a></p>

              <p>Imagine being able to organize and structure your Arquillian tests as human-readable <em>specifications by example</em> that describe at a high-level how the application should work, then being able to present illustrated documentation generated from a test run that gives all parties an account of the features under development and tracks feature sign-off through automation of the acceptance criteria.</p>
              <p>This goal can be achieved by <a href="http://www.thucydides.info">Thucydides</a> and <a href="http://arquillian.org">Arquillian</a> joining forces. Acceptance tests will not only be agile and illustrated, but fully automated. With a <a href="https://github.com/VineetReynolds/thucydides-arquillian-example">proof of concept</a> in hand, we plan to advance this combination, including substituting Arquillian Drone to manage WebDriver, at the <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2012/devoxx/syzdq">Devoxx 2012 Hackergarten</a>.</p>
              <h3>Introducing the candidates</h3>
              <h4>What is Thucydides?</h4>
              <p><img src="/images/blog/thucydides-logo.png" class="pull-right" alt="" /> Thucydides is a testing tool that encourages developers write more flexible and reusable end-to-end acceptance tests. In the style of <a href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-08-2011/110823-atdd-for-web-apps.html" title="ATDD">Acceptance Test-Driven Development</a>, Thucydides introduces a narrative for tests that describes the high-level requirements and automates the acceptance criteria using the tests. Developers then iterate using a test-driven approach to complete the requirements (i.e., stories), as depicted in the diagram below.</p>
              <p><img src="/images/blog/thucydides-workflow.png" class="graphic" alt="" /></p>
              <p>By analyzing the test metadata and test results, Thucydides generates illustrated documentation that describes how the application is used in the form of high-level requirements, acceptance criteria and screenshots, and records the progress of development.</p>
              <p><img src="/images/blog/thucydides-story-status.png" alt="" /></p>
              <h4>What is Arquillian?</h4>
              <p>Arquillian is open source software that empowers you to test JVM-based applications more effectively. Created to defend the software galaxy from bugs, Arquillian brings your test to the runtime so you can focus on testing your application&#8217;s behavior rather than managing the runtime. Using Arquillian, you can develop a comprehensive suite of tests from the convenience of your IDE and run them in any IDE, build tool or continuous integration environment.</p>
              <h4>What is Arquillian Drone?</h4>
              <p>Arquillian Drone is an extension to Arquillian that manages the lifecycle of browsers for the purpose of controlling them from a test, thus simplifying automated functional / acceptance testing. Drone bootstraps the tooling necessary to send commands to the browser (e.g. Selenium Server, WebDriver, etc), spawns an instance of a browser, injects the browser API into the test class to allow tests to control that instance and, finally, properly disposes of the browser instance after the test is complete.</p>
              <h3>Integration benefits</h3>
              <h4>Arquillian and Thucydides as yin and yang</h4>
              <p>While Thucydides handles automation of the browser&#8212;via the <a href="http://seleniumhq.org/docs/03_webdriver.html">WebDriver</a> library&#8212;it does not handle deploying the application being tested, nor does it manage the lifecycle of the container to which the application is deployed. In other words, it doesn&#8217;t automate <em>everything</em>. That&#8217;s where Arquillian steps in.</p>
              <p>Thucydides brings the ATDD methodology and rich test reports to Arquillian, both new features to the Arquillian ecosystem. Arquillian complements Thucydides by managing the lifecycle of the container and deploying the application (as a whole or micro-deployment) to it. These services would otherwise need to be handled by the build when using Thucydides alone.</p>
              <p>Beyond their combined core feature set, the integration brings all of the Arquillian extensions to Thucydides tests, opening the door to services such as loading seed data into the database, measuring performance and even managing browser automation. Speaking of managing browser automation&#8230;</p>
              <h4>More powerful browser automation with Drone</h4>
              <p>Bringing Arquillian Drone into the fold provides additional benefit by introducing a more powerful and flexible choice for controlling the browser in a Thucydides test, including simplified configuration, alternatives to WebDriver and extensions (e.g., Graphene). This secondary integration between Arquillian and Thucydides also unifies the developer experience with regard to how the browser is controlled across vanilla Arquillian Drone tests and Thucydides tests (embracing the concept that each tool should focus on doing one thing well).</p>
              <p>Basic integration between Arquillian and Thucydides is a first step and getting Drone integrated is an optional (but valuable) bonus.</p>
              <h4>How this integration helps test writers</h4>
              <ul>
              	<li>Arquillian tests become contract deliverables by leveraging Thucydides&#8217; language for ATDD</li>
              	<li>Test segments of the webapp in isolation (using micro-deployments)
              	<ul>
              		<li>Accelerates acceptance testing because entire application doesn&#8217;t have to be built and deployed</li>
              	</ul></li>
              	<li>Skip the build (e.g., Run As &gt; XYZ Test in the IDE)
              	<ul>
              		<li>automatic container lifecycle management</li>
              		<li>deploy test archive defined in test class</li>
              		<li>inject application (initial) URL into test</li>
              	</ul></li>
              	<li>Support for multiple target environments (e.g., local, dev, qa, staging)</li>
              	<li>Write Thucydides tests using other test runners, such as TestNG and Spock</li>
              	<li>Write Thucydides tests using any Arquillian-supported programming model (CDI, Spring, etc)</li>
              	<li>Rich reports summarizing test results generated by Thucydides, something Arquillian doesn&#8217;t currently provide</li>
              	<li>Use additional Arquillian extensions in Thucydides tests</li>
              	<li>Integrated configuration (arquillian.xml) for containers and browsers*</li>
              	<li>Use alternate browser automation libraries supported by Drone*</li>
              	<li>Use Graphene page fragments to reduce boilerplate code common in acceptance tests*</li>
              </ul>
              <p>* requires Drone integration</p>
              <h4>Balancing responsibility</h4>
              <p>Thucydides&#8217; strong suit is promoting ATDD through its programming model for writing acceptance tests as specifications by example and its reporting pipeline that summarizes test results as user stories. We believe Thucydides could move faster by focusing on tools and metrics needed to facilitate ATDD, allowing Arquillian to address the need of general purpose test extensions such as alternate test runners, data loading, browser automation, programming model integration, etc. In other words, Thucydides has more freedom to focus on its core competency, as stated on its website:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Organize and structure acceptance tests, associate tests with the user stories or features that they test and generate illustrated documentation describing how the application is used based on the stories described by the tests.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <h3>Hacking on the integration</h3>
              <p>We plan to hack on this idea during the Hackergarten at Devoxx 2012. Keep in mind there is a <a href="https://github.com/VineetReynolds/thucydides-arquillian-example">proof of concept</a> we can reference as a starting point, described later in this section.</p>
              <p>John Smart, the author of Thucydides, has offered to host the integration in the Thucydides code base, which is fantastic.</p>
              <h4>When and where are we hacking?</h4>
              <p>We are going to use the free Hackergarten day at Devoxx 2012 as an opportunity to put our heads together to make progress on this integration. Here are the details:</p>
              <ul>
              	<li>When: Tue 13th November 2012, 09:30 &#8211; 16:30</li>

              <h4>What we want to achieve</h4>
              <p>The following two tests are proposed milestones we want to achieve during the hack. They contrast what integration looks like without Drone to the integration with Drone. Thinking through these scenarios helps reveal integartion points that need to be exposed or refined.</p>
              <p class="info"><span>The tests in this section apply to the <a href="https://github.com/bartoszmajsak/Beer-Advisor">Beer Advisor</a> sample application.</span></p>
              <p><strong>Sample test without Drone integration</strong></p>
              <pre class="prettify"><code class="prettify">@RunWith(ThucydidesRunner.class) // or @RunWith(Arquillian.class)&#x000A;@Story(BeerAdvisorFeatures.SearchingBeers.class)&#x000A;public class SearchingBeersStory {</code>&#x000A;&#x000A;<code class="prettify">    // Thucydides members</code>&#x000A;&#x000A;<code class="prettify">    @Managed(uniqueSession = true)&#x000A;    public WebDriver browser;</code>&#x000A;&#x000A;<code class="prettify">    @ManagedPages&#x000A;    public Pages pages;</code>&#x000A;&#x000A;<code class="prettify">    @Steps&#x000A;    public SearchingSteps searchingSteps;</code>&#x000A;&#x000A;<code class="prettify">    // Arquillian members</code>&#x000A;&#x000A;<code class="prettify">    @Deployment(testable = false)&#x000A;    public static WebArchive createTestArchive() {&#x000A;       return ShrinkWrap.create(WebArchive.class, "searching-beers-story.war")...;&#x000A;    }</code>&#x000A;&#x000A;<code class="prettify">    @ArquillianResource&#x000A;    URL deploymentUrl;</code>&#x000A;&#x000A;<code class="prettify">    // Tests</code>&#x000A;&#x000A;<code class="prettify">    @Before&#x000A;    public void before_tests() {&#x000A;        pages.setDefaultBaseUrl(deploymentUrl.toExternalForm());&#x000A;    }</code>&#x000A;&#x000A;<code class="prettify">    @Test&#x000A;    public void should_find_all_usa_beers() {&#x000A;        searchingSteps.on_main_beer_advisor_page();&#x000A;        searchingSteps.search_for("from usa");&#x000A;        searchingSteps.should_contain_beers(new Beer("90 minute IPA"), new Beer("Mirror Pond"));&#x000A;    }&#x000A;}</code></pre>
              <p>The following steps outline the interplay between Arquillian and Thucydides while the test executes in this scenario.</p>
              <ul>
              	<li>Either Arquillian or Thucydides takes over test execution and activate both frameworks</li>
              	<li>Responding to the test suite start event, Arquillian and configures and starts (or connects to) the container</li>
              	<li>Arquillian deploys test archive(s) to container</li>
              	<li>Arquillian injects the application URL into the @ArquillianResource URL inject point of the test</li>
              	<li>Thucydides spawns a browser instance using WebDriver</li>
              	<li>Thucydides executes tests, sending browser commands to WebDriver</li>
              	<li>Thucydides takes screenshots using WebDriver as the browser is interacting with the web application</li>
              	<li>Thucydides destoys the browser instance using WebDriver</li>
              	<li>Arquillian undeploys the test archive</li>
              	<li>Arquillian stops the container</li>
              	<li>Thucydides generates reports from the high-level summarizes, screenshots and test results</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Any Arquillian extensions that are loaded should also work as normal.</p>
              <p><strong>Sample test with Drone integration</strong></p>
              <pre class="prettify"><code class="prettify">@RunWith(ThucydidesRunner.class) // or @RunWith(Arquillian.class)&#x000A;@Story(BeerAdvisorFeatures.SearchingBeers.class)&#x000A;public class SearchingBeersStory {</code>&#x000A;&#x000A;<code class="prettify">    // Thucydides members</code>&#x000A;&#x000A;<code class="prettify">    @Steps&#x000A;    public SearchingSteps searchingSteps;</code>&#x000A;&#x000A;<code class="prettify">    // Arquillian members</code>&#x000A;&#x000A;<code class="prettify">    @Deployment(testable = false)&#x000A;    public static WebArchive createTestArchive() {&#x000A;       return ShrinkWrap.create(WebArchive.class, "searching-beers-story.war")...;&#x000A;    }</code>&#x000A;&#x000A;<code class="prettify">    @Drone // may get moved to the page objects&#x000A;    public WebDriver browser;</code>&#x000A;&#x000A;<code class="prettify">    // Tests</code>&#x000A;&#x000A;<code class="prettify">    @Test&#x000A;    public void should_find_all_usa_beers() {&#x000A;        searchingSteps.on_main_beer_advisor_page();&#x000A;        searchingSteps.search_for("from usa");&#x000A;        searchingSteps.should_contain_beers(new Beer("90 minute IPA"), new Beer("Mirror Pond"));&#x000A;    }&#x000A;}</code></pre>
              <p>The following steps outline the interplay between Arquillian and Thucydides while the test executes in this scenario.</p>
              <ul>
              	<li>Either Arquillian or Thucydides takes over test execution and activate both frameworks</li>
              	<li>Arquillian configures and starts (or connects to) the container</li>

              	<li>Arquillian injects the application URL into the @ArquillianResource URL injection point of the test</li>
              	<li>Arquillian Drone spawns a browser instance using the configured browser automation library (e.g., WebDriver)</li>
              	<li>Arquillian Drone sets the default base URL on the managed pages</li>
              	<li>Thucydides executes tests, sending browser commands to the browser automation library</li>
              	<li>Arquillian Drone takes screenshots as the browser is interacting with the web application</li>
              	<li>Arquillian Drone destoys the browser instance using the configured browser automation library</li>

              	<li>Thucydides generates reports from the high-level summarizes, screenshots and test results</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Any Arquillian Drone extensions, such as Graphene, that are loaded should also work as normal.</p>
              <h4>Sample code to use for exploring the integration</h4>
              <ul>
              	<li><a href="https://github.com/bartoszmajsak/Beer-Advisor">Beer Advisor</a> by Bartosz Majsak</li>
              	<li><a href="https://github.com/VineetReynolds/thucydides-arquillian-example">Currency Exchange</a> by Vineet Reynolds</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Prior work</h4>
              <p>Vineet Reynolds has been experimenting with <a href="https://github.com/VineetReynolds/thucydides-arquillian-example/">an integration between Thucydides and Arquillian Core</a>. Vineet&#8217;s integration code uses a Thucydides <a href="https://github.com/VineetReynolds/thucydides-arquillian-example/blob/master/src/test/java/com/mycompany/listeners/ArquillianListener.java">StepListener implementation</a> to weave the Arquillian lifecycle into the test. Tests are run using the Thucydides testrunner, while Arquillian manages the container lifecycle and performs the deployment of archives defined in the tests. The integration does not incorporate Arquillian Drone, opting to leave management of WebDriver up to Thucydides.</p>
              <p>Aslak and Bartosz improved upon the integration and incorporated it into the <a href="https://github.com/bartoszmajsak/Beer-Advisor">Beer Advisor sample app</a> for their JavaZone talk in September 2012. They introduced a <a href="https://github.com/bartoszmajsak/Beer-Advisor/blob/master/thucydides-tests/src/test/java/org/arquillian/example/thucydides/ArquillianEnricher.java">JUnit Rule</a> that activates the Arquillian services that run before and after each test method, such as test enrichment. A JUnit Rule is currently necessary due to insufficient hooks in Thucydides, but it gets the job done. Eventually we want to phase out the JUnit Rule because it exposes integration plumbing in the test.</p>
              <h4>Engineering challenges</h4>
              <p><strong>Challenge #1: Unified test runner</strong></p>
              <p>Thucydides needs a startup API that isn&#8217;t coupled with JUnit so that Arquillian is able to perform the startup in an extension. At the moment there is a lot of setup code in the <a href="https://github.com/thucydides-webtests/thucydides/blob/master/thucydides-junit/src/main/java/net/thucydides/junit/runners/ThucydidesRunner.java">ThucydidesRunner</a> to reproduce. The alternative is that Thucydides provides enough hooks in its <a href="https://github.com/thucydides-webtests/thucydides/blob/master/thucydides-core/src/main/java/net/thucydides/core/steps/StepEventBus.java">StepEventBus</a> for Arquillian to hook its own startup into the Thucydides lifecycle. In the integration prototype, a JUnit rule is used to activate Arquillian in a Thucydides test, but this is not the most elegant approach.</p>
              <p>Ideally, the <code>@RunWith(Arquillian.class)</code> annotation should be enough for Arquillian to drive Thucydides if Arquillian detects Thucydides is also in use (e.g., the <code>@Story</code> annotation is present on the test class). This is the preferred approach since it simplifies the experience for the user across the test suite (a single <code>@RunWith</code> for all integration tests) and it may make the integration more compatible with extensions since Arquillian has a more sophisticated event bus.</p>
              <p><strong>Challenge #2: Drone integration</strong></p>
              <p>When Drone is integrated, the user has an option to use the browser automation library (directly or via the page object pattern) as with other Drone tests or use the page object support provided by Thucydides. Drone should be able to pass Thucydides the WebDriver instance so that Thucydides can operate its own page objects.</p>
              <p>Ideally, the integration with Drone should cut down on as many redundant declarations in the class as possible to simplify test authoring. That means that the <code>@Drone</code> injection point is used to access the browser instance and and <code>@ArquillianResource URL</code> injection point is used to access the initial (base) url.</p>
              <p>Karel Piwko mentioned that Drone needs a better SPI for improved integration with Arquillian Graphene, slated for 1.2.0.Final. He believes the Drone SPI will also help facilitate Thucydides integration. It also opens the door for Drone to be integrated into Thucydides on its own.</p>
              <p><strong>Happy hacking!</strong></p>

              <p>Tools like <em>Arquillian Graphene</em>, <em>WebDriver</em>, or just plain <em>Selenium</em> combined with concepts like <a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/PageObjects"><em>Page Objects</em></a> can help you automate your functional(integration, whatever&#8230;) web UI tests. We have already introduced some of the advances brought to you by <em>Arquillian Graphene</em> <a href="http://arquillian.org/blog/tags/graphene/">earlier</a>. In this blog entry we will look a bit deeper into a new concept introduced in <em>Arquillian Graphene</em> 2.0.0.Alpha2; <em>Page Fragments</em>.</p>
              <p>Consider the following example taken from the RichFaces <a href="http://showcase.richfaces.org/richfaces/component-sample.jsf?demo=autocomplete&amp;sample=modes&amp;skin=blueSky">component showcase</a>. The page under test contain three Autocomplete widgets.</p>
              <pre class="prettify"><code class="prettify">public class TestAutocompleteWidgets extends AbstractGrapheneTest {</code>&#x000A;&#x000A;<code class="prettify">    private JQueryLocator minCharInput = jq("input[type=text]:eq(0)");&#x000A;    private JQueryLocator multipleSelectionInput = jq("input[type=text]:eq(1)");&#x000A;    private JQueryLocator selectFirstFalseInput = jq("input[type=text]:eq(2)");&#x000A;    private JQueryLocator selection = jq("div.rf-au-itm");</code>&#x000A;&#x000A;<code class="prettify">    @Test&#x000A;    public void testFirstAutocomplete() {</code>&#x000A;&#x000A;<code class="prettify">        graphene.keyPress(minCharInput, 'a');</code>&#x000A;&#x000A;<code class="prettify">        assertFalse(graphene.isElementPresent(selection),&#x000A;            "The suggestion list should not be visible, since there is only one char!");</code>&#x000A;&#x000A;<code class="prettify">        String keys = "ar";&#x000A;        graphene.focus(minCharInput);&#x000A;        selenium.type(minCharInput, keys);&#x000A;        guardXhr(graphene).fireEvent(minCharInput, Event.KEYPRESS);</code>&#x000A;&#x000A;<code class="prettify">        assertTrue(graphene.isVisible(selection), &#x000A;            "The suggestion list should be visible, since there are two chars!");</code>&#x000A;&#x000A;<code class="prettify">        String actualArizona = graphene.getText(jq(selection.getRawLocator() + ":eq(0)"));&#x000A;        assertEquals(actualArizona, "Arizona", "The provided suggestion should be Arizona!");</code>&#x000A;&#x000A;<code class="prettify">        String actualArkansas = graphene.getText(jq(selection.getRawLocator() + ":eq(1)"));&#x000A;        assertEquals(actualArkansas, "Arkansas", "The provided suggestion should be Arkansas!");</code>&#x000A;&#x000A;<code class="prettify">    }</code>&#x000A;&#x000A;<code class="prettify">    @Test&#x000A;    public void testSecondAutocomplete() {</code>&#x000A;&#x000A;<code class="prettify">        char key = 'a';&#x000A;        selenium.focus(multipleSelectionInput);&#x000A;        guardXhr(selenium).keyPress(multipleSelectionInput, key);</code>&#x000A;&#x000A;<code class="prettify">        assertTrue(selenium.isVisible(selection),&#x000A;            "The suggestion list should be visible, since there is correct starting char!");</code>&#x000A;&#x000A;<code class="prettify">        selenium.keyPressNative(KeyEvent.VK_ENTER);</code>&#x000A;&#x000A;<code class="prettify">        key = ' ';&#x000A;        selenium.keyPress(multipleSelectionInput, key);</code>&#x000A;&#x000A;<code class="prettify">        key = 'w';</code>&#x000A;&#x000A;<code class="prettify">        selenium.focus(multipleSelectionInput);&#x000A;        guardXhr(selenium).keyPress(multipleSelectionInput, key);</code>&#x000A;&#x000A;<code class="prettify">        assertTrue(selenium.isVisible(selection),&#x000A;            "The suggestion list should be visible, since there is correct starting char!");</code>&#x000A;&#x000A;<code class="prettify">        selenium.keyPressNative(KeyEvent.VK_ENTER);</code>&#x000A;&#x000A;<code class="prettify">        String actualContentOfInput = selenium.getValue(multipleSelectionInput);&#x000A;        assertEquals(actualContentOfInput, "Alabama Washington", "The input should contain something else!");&#x000A;    }</code>&#x000A;&#x000A;<code class="prettify">    @Test&#x000A;    public void testThirdAutocomplete() {&#x000A;        //similar autocomplete interactions as in the previous tests&#x000A;    }&#x000A;}</code></pre>
              <h3>Now, ask yourself the following questions:</h3>
              <ul>
              	<li><em>Do you find these types of tests less robust than for example unit tests for the persistence layer?</em></li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              	<li><em>Do you think these tests still pass when the underlying HTML change?</em></li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              	<li><em>Do you see repeating code in the these tests?</em></li>
              </ul>
              <p>In my opinion you should have a clean answer to all of these questions. You are probably aware that tests should be loosely coupled with the underlying HTML structure of the application under test as it makes tests more robust and changes in the HTML structure of the page will not directly affect all tests.</p>
              <p>Let&#8217;s apply the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/PageObjects"><em>Page Objects</em></a> pattern to split the HTML structure and the test logic. The <em>Page Object</em> will encapsulate the HTML structure so when the HTML change, only your <em>Page Objects</em> has to change.</p>
              <ul>
              	<li><em>But what about when I&#8217;m testing another application that use the same Autocomplete widget?</em></li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              	<li><em>Should I copy the part of the Page Object that interact with the Autocomplete widget and paste it around in my code?</em></li>
              </ul>
              <p>But as you&#8217;re already thinking: this would be a major don&#8217;t-repeat-yourself violation! Is there something we could do to improve this?</p>
              <p><strong>Yes, there is! Arquillian Graphene <em>Page Fragments</em> to the rescue!</strong></p>
              <h3><em>Page Fragments</em>, what are they?</h3>
              <ul>
              	<li><em>Page Fragments</em> are any repeating part of a page, any widget, web component, etc.</li>
              	<li>They encapsulate parts of the page into reusable test components across your whole test suite.</li>
              	<li>You can differentiate each fragment by its root element and reference other elements as children of that root.</li>
              	<li>They leverage Selenium WebDriver under the hood combined with all of the killer features of <em>Graphene</em>.</li>
              	<li>And they come with a set of utilities which simplify using them within tests and <em>Page Objects</em>.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>How to define <em>Page Fragments</em></h3>
              <pre class="prettify"><code class="prettify">public class AutocompleteFragment&lt;T&gt; {</code>&#x000A;&#x000A;<code class="prettify">    @Root&#x000A;    WebElement root;</code>&#x000A;&#x000A;<code class="prettify">    @FindBy(css = "input[type='text']")&#x000A;    WebElement inputToWrite;</code>&#x000A;&#x000A;<code class="prettify">    public static final String CLASS_NAME_SUGGESTION = "rf-au-itm";</code>&#x000A;&#x000A;<code class="prettify">    public List&lt;Suggestion&lt;T&gt;&gt; getAllSuggestions(SuggestionParser&lt;T&gt; parser) {&#x000A;        List&lt;Suggestion&lt;T&gt;&gt; allSugg = new ArrayList&lt;Suggestion&lt;T&gt;&gt;();</code>&#x000A;&#x000A;<code class="prettify">        if (areSuggestionsAvailable()) {&#x000A;            WebElement rightSuggList = getRightSuggestionList();&#x000A;            List&lt;WebElement&gt; suggestions = rightSuggList.findElements(&#x000A;                        By.className(CLASS_NAME_SUGGESTION));</code>&#x000A;&#x000A;<code class="prettify">            for (WebElement suggestion : suggestions) {&#x000A;                allSugg.add(parser.parse(suggestion));&#x000A;            }&#x000A;        }</code>&#x000A;&#x000A;<code class="prettify">        return allSugg;&#x000A;    }</code>&#x000A;&#x000A;<code class="prettify">    public List&lt;Suggestion&lt;T&gt;&gt; type(String value, SuggestionParser&lt;T&gt; parser) {&#x000A;        List&lt;Suggestion&lt;T&gt;&gt; suggestions = new ArrayList&lt;Suggestion&lt;T&gt;&gt;();</code>&#x000A;&#x000A;<code class="prettify">        inputToWrite.sendKeys(value);&#x000A;        try {&#x000A;            waitForSuggestions();&#x000A;        } catch (TimeoutException ex) {&#x000A;            // no suggestions available&#x000A;            return suggestions;&#x000A;        }</code>&#x000A;&#x000A;<code class="prettify">        suggestions = getAllSuggestions(parser);&#x000A;        return suggestions;&#x000A;    }</code>&#x000A;&#x000A;<code class="prettify">    //other handy encapsulation of Autocomplete services&#x000A;}</code></pre>
              <p class="info"><span>The example is just a snippet from the full implementation of the RichFaces Autocomplete component.</span></p>
              <p>Notice the <code>@Root</code> annotation? The value of the root field is automatically injected by <em>Graphene</em>. The <code>root</code> field contain the root element as defined by the <code>@FindBy</code> annotation on the injection point of the <em>Page Fragment</em> in the Page Object or test. All <code>@FindBy</code> fields in the <em>Page Fragment</em> will use this root as a starting point.</p>
              <p>The fragment implementation is pretty generic and therefore reusable in all tests in all applications that use the Autocomplete widget. A full implementation would encapsulate all the services this fragment provide, but it could for example also encapsulate browser specific interactions like submit or click actions. There are no boundaries!</p>
              <h3>Using <em>Page Fragments</em> and <em>Page Objects</em> together</h3>
              <p>Let&#8217;s rewrite the previous test to use our new <em>Page Fragment</em> together with our <em>Page Object</em>.</p>
              <p>First we define a <em>Page Object</em> which contain the structure of the page under test.</p>
              <pre class="prettify"><code class="prettify">public class TestPage {</code>&#x000A;    &#x000A;<code class="prettify">    @FindBy(css = "div.rf-au:nth-of-type(1)")&#x000A;    private AutocompleteFragment&lt;String&gt; autocomplete1;</code>&#x000A;&#x000A;<code class="prettify">    @FindBy(css = "div.rf-au:nth-of-type(2)")&#x000A;    private AutocompleteFragment&lt;String&gt; autocomplete2;</code>&#x000A;&#x000A;<code class="prettify">    @FindBy(css = "div.rf-au:nth-of-type(3)")&#x000A;    private AutocompleteFragment&lt;String&gt; autocomplete3;</code>&#x000A;&#x000A;<code class="prettify">    @FindBy(xpath = "//*[contains(@id,'sh1')]")&#x000A;    private WebElement viewSourceLink;</code>&#x000A;&#x000A;<code class="prettify">    //all getters for the fields</code>&#x000A;&#x000A;<code class="prettify">    //other handy methods which you find useful when testing those three Autocomplete widgets&#x000A;}</code></pre>
              <p>Declaring the <em>Page Fragment</em> in the <em>Page Object</em> is the preferred option, but you can also declare the <em>Page Fragment</em> directly in the test if desired. The only thing you need to do is to annotate the <em>Page Fragment</em> object with WebDriver&#8217;s <code>@FindBy</code> annotation to refer to the fragment&#8217;s root DOM element. That simple!</p>
              <p>Graphene differentiates between <em>Page Fragments</em> and plain <em>WebElements</em> in the same Page Object so they can be declared side by side. All of the <strong>initialization is done automatically</strong>, so there is no need to initialize the <em>Page Fragments</em> or <em>Page Objects</em> in the <code>@Before</code> method of your test case.</p>
              <p>In this last example we see how the autocomplete widgets&#8217;s <em>Page Fragment</em> is used in the test case.</p>
              <pre class="prettify"><code class="prettify">public class TestWhichUsesPageFragments extend AbstractTest {</code>&#x000A;&#x000A;<code class="prettify">    @Page&#x000A;    private TestPage testPage;</code>&#x000A;&#x000A;<code class="prettify">    @Test&#x000A;    public void testFirstAutocomplete {&#x000A;        AutocompleteFragment&lt;String&gt; autocomplete = testPage.getAutocomplete1();</code>&#x000A;        &#x000A;<code class="prettify">        autocomplete.type("a");</code>&#x000A;&#x000A;<code class="prettify">        assertFalse(autocomplete.areSuggestionsAvailable(), &#x000A;            "The suggestion list should not be visible, since there is only one char!");</code>&#x000A;&#x000A;<code class="prettify">        String keys = "ar";&#x000A;        autocomplete.type(keys);</code>&#x000A;&#x000A;<code class="prettify">        assertTrue(autocomplete.areSuggestionsAvailable(), &#x000A;            "The suggestion list should be visible, since there are two chars!");</code>&#x000A;&#x000A;<code class="prettify">        List&lt;Suggestion&lt;String&gt;&gt; expectedSuggestions = new ArrayList&lt;Suggestion&lt;String&gt;&gt;();&#x000A;        expectedSuggestions.add(new Suggestion&lt;String&gt;("Arizona"));&#x000A;        expectedSuggestions.add(new Suggestion&lt;String&gt;("Arkansas"));</code>&#x000A;&#x000A;<code class="prettify">        assertEquals(autocomplete.getAllSuggestions(new StringSuggestionParser()), expectedSuggestions, &#x000A;            "Suggestions are wrong!");&#x000A;    }</code>&#x000A;&#x000A;<code class="prettify">    @Test&#x000A;    public void testSecondAutocomplete() {&#x000A;        AutocompleteFragment&lt;String&gt; autocomplete = testPage.getAutocomplete2();</code>&#x000A;&#x000A;<code class="prettify">        String key = "a";&#x000A;        autocomplete.type(key);</code>&#x000A;        &#x000A;<code class="prettify">        String errorMsg = "The suggestion list should be visible, since there was typed correct char ";&#x000A;        assertTrue(autocomplete.areSuggestionsAvailable(), errorMsg + key);</code>&#x000A;&#x000A;<code class="prettify">        autocomplete.autocomplete(autocomplete.getFirstSuggestion());</code>&#x000A;&#x000A;<code class="prettify">        autocomplete.type(" ");</code>&#x000A;&#x000A;<code class="prettify">        key = "w"&#x000A;        autocomplete.type(key);</code>&#x000A;&#x000A;<code class="prettify">        assertTrue(autocomplete.areSuggestionsAvailable(), errorMsg + key);</code>&#x000A;&#x000A;<code class="prettify">        autocomplete.autocomplete(autocomplete.getFirstSuggestion());        </code>&#x000A;&#x000A;<code class="prettify">        String actualContentOfInput = autocomplete.getInputValue();&#x000A;        assertEquals(actualContentOfInput, "Alabama Washington", "The input should contain something else!");&#x000A;    }</code>&#x000A;&#x000A;<code class="prettify">    @Test&#x000A;    public void testThirdAutocomplete() {&#x000A;        //similar autocomplete interactions as in the previous tests&#x000A;    }&#x000A;}</code></pre>
              <p>As your application grow, the only thing that needs to change is the root references of your <em>Page Fragments</em>. Last but not least you will be able to make your <em>Page Fragment</em> availabe to be used by other tests in other applications.</p>
              <p>To try <em>Page Fragments</em> check out the Graphene 2.0.0.Alpha2 release. Getting start information can be found in the <a href="https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/ARQGRA2/Page+Abstractions">Reference Documentation</a>.</p>

              <p><img src="/images/blog/gsoc2012_official_350.jpg" class="pull-right" alt="" /> The <a href="http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2012/04/students-announced-for-google-summer-of.html">much anticipated announcement</a> about which students were selected to participate in the <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2012">2012 Google Summer of Code program</a> was published earlier today. In total, there are 1,212 students participating. We&#8217;d like to congratulate all the students accepted and wish you all best of luck this summer!</p>
              <p>The JBoss Community is proud to be participating as an independent mentor organization for the first time this year. We were selected thanks to a strong showing of volunteer mentors and an <a href="https://community.jboss.org/wiki/GSoC12Ideas">overwhelming number of compelling and creative ideas</a>. More than half of the ideas came from the Arquillian community ~:)</p>
              <p>I&#8217;d like to extend a big <strong>thank you</strong> to everyone who came forward with ideas. Acceptances aside, these ideas are already helping shape the future of the various JBoss projects.</p>
              <h3>Accepted projects</h3>
              <p>The Arquillian project is excited to announce that we have 2 students participating this year!</p>
              <p><img src="/images/blog/gsoc2012_jboss_480.jpg" style="margin-top: 6px;" class="pull-left" alt="" /> Google granted the JBoss Community 8 student slots. From those 8 slots, Arquillian was allotted 2 slots&#8212;far less than the number of excellent proposals submitted. After much agonizing over the decision for the last week, the Arquillian mentors decided to award the slots to the following two student proposals:</p>

              <p>Jakub Narloch is already well on his way to bringing Spring testing support to Arquillian having implemented a prototype. You can read about the status of his prototype in the <a href="https://community.jboss.org/thread/197356">GSoC &#8211; Arquillian Spring integration</a> forum thread.</p>
              <p>Jakub Dunia, with his insight into problem solving, has already demonstrated he&#8217;ll be invaluable member of our community. The project he has chosen to support is extremely innovative, not only in scope of Arquillian, but in UI testing in general.</p>
              <p><b>Congratulations Jakub * 2!</b></p>
              <p>There&#8217;s an additional testing-related proposal, sponsored by the Errai team, that was also accepted:</p>

              <h4>Next steps</h4>
              <p>Jakub, Jakub and Ognjen, please contact your mentors immediately. Make a plan to communicate with your mentor regularly, at minimum, once each week. Since we&#8217;re big believers in openness, the best way to keep in touch is through a public channel such as the <a href="http://community.jboss.org/en/arquillian/dev?view=discussions">Arquillian development forum</a> or the #arquillian channel on Freenode IRC.</p>
              <p>We plan to publish status reports on these projects here at <a href="http://arquillian.org">arquillian.org</a> to allow the community to follow your progress and provide feedback. For those watching, stay tuned!</p>
              <h3>Promising proposals</h3>
              <p>Although we could only accept two proposals, there were <em>many</em> well-written proposals that truly deserved a slot (if only we had more to give). I&#8217;d like to thank the students for the time they spent preparing and submitting the proposals by highlighting them here. The rating shown under each proposal is the average rating (out of 5) given by the JBoss mentors who voted.</p>

              <p>Despite the fact that these proposals were not accepted into GSoC, we <em>really</em> want to see them pursued. We view this program as an opportunity to interact with the next generation of the JBoss Community and to help them discover, or reinforce, their passion for open source. In fact, several students, including Chaitanya Nalla, have already expressed interest in contributing to Arquillian despite not being accepted to GSoC. That&#8217;s the spirit!</p>
              <p>As Anil mentioned on the <a href="http://lists.jboss.org/pipermail/gsoc/2012-April/000100.html">JBoss GSoC mailinglist</a>, we&#8217;re exploring a diverse approach to enable students to continue their proposals, ranging from Red Hat summer internships to community-supported projects. Our plan is to closely track the GSoC schedule to keep the projects on track and to give you, the students, the experience the comes with completing a summer project (and likely increase your chance of being awarded a slot next year). Stay tuned for details.</p>
              <h4>What&#8217;s next?</h4>
              <p>Keep an eye on this blog for periodic progress reports about the GSoC student projects and any additional non-GSoC summer projects.</p>
              <p>The first milestone is May 21st, when coding officially begins (trust me, these guys will be way ahead of that scheduled date). The mid-term evaluations happen mid July and the projects wrap up in mid August. See the <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/events/google/gsoc2012">official timeline</a> for all the dates.</p>
              <p>Even when GSoC ends, the community continues on! We hope summer students stay involved in the community long after the hacking days of summer.</p>

              <p>In the Arquillian project, we&#8217;re all about <em>real</em> tests. There&#8217;s a good reason for this philosophy. If you use mocks or a substitute container when testing code that uses a programming model (i.e., CDI), all you can be sure of is that you&#8217;ve faked out enough functionality to get the test to work. You can&#8217;t be certain that your code works&#8212;really, truly works.</p>
              <p>Obviously, we provide adapters for embedded containers (i.e., substitute containers). The reason is, they often do a decent enough job of simultating the real environment that we are willing to make the trade-off for its variations when we are working in development. I would expect, though, that you are also running the same tests in CI using a real container&#8230;just to get that peace of mind.</p>
              <h3>How do you know when <em>not</em> to use an embedded container?</h3>
              <p>If you write a test that you are positive should work, but instead throws some wacky exception, <em>immediately stop and try the same test in a real container</em>. For example, if you are using Embedded GlassFish, I would advise running the test in managed or remote GlassFish. The latter two adapters both use an authentic GlassFish instance. If the test passes, then you have answered the question of this section.</p>
              <p><strong>When the embedded container begins to act inconsistently, drop it.</strong></p>
              <p>As with all things, there are exceptions to the rule. If the code really <em>should</em> work on the embedded container, then it may be worth exploring why it isn&#8217;t. That may lead you to the discovery of a bug in the library you&#8217;re using. If debugging the library is your main concern, chase it down. If you are just trying to get a test written for your application, stop using the embedded container (or save debugging it for a rainy day).</p>
              <h3>Examples</h3>
              <p>See <a href="https://community.jboss.org/message/729776">this thread</a> in the Seam 3 forums for an example where the Embedded GlassFish container was acting more of a hindrence than a help. The thread includes the steps I took to get a <strong class="greenbar">green bar</strong> using a different GlassFish container adapter.</p>
              <p><a href="https://community.jboss.org/people/myfear">Markus Eisele</a> identifies another hazard. He points out in a <a href="http://blog.eisele.net/2012/01/arquillian-with-netbeans-glassfish_18.html">recent blog post</a> that testing JPA using Embedded GlassFish is problematic because JPA weaving (in EclipseLink) does not occur:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>[Weaving] only works when the entity classes to be weaved only exist in the application classloader. The combination of Embedded GlassFish, Arquillian and the Maven Surefire Plugin mix this up a bit and the end of the story is, that exactly none of your entities are enhanced at all.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Again, testing on Embedded GlassFish is not serving us well in this scenario. Graduate.</p>
              <h3>Closing thoughts</h3>
              <p>Code that uses Solder works fine on GlassFish 3.1.2, but it does not play very nicely with Embedded GlassFish&#8212;it&#8217;s just a hostile environment for CDI because of the visibility issues that come with starting an embedded container inside an existing Java process. The same goes for JPA. You end up in a minefield of class visibility and access problems, and far from making any progress writing tests (your ultimate goal).</p>
              <p>If you want the container to start automatically like with embedded, then switch to a managed container. It works almost exactly the same as the remote container, except that Arquillian will start the standalone process at the beginning of the test execution and stop it at the end. In other words:</p>
              <p>managed &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; embedded</p>
              <p>It&#8217;s clean. It&#8217;s true.</p>
              <p>For speed of development:</p>
              <p>remote &gt; managed</p>
              <p>With remote, you don&#8217;t have to wait for the container to start&#8230;and you can start it in debug mode very easily and keep it there. That&#8217;s why I say that the best container adapters for development are the remote adapters and the best adapters for CI are the managed adapters. I personally don&#8217;t like the embedded container adapters much (with the exception of embedded CDI since that&#8217;s mostly a pure standalone CDI environment).</p>
              <p>Keep that advice in mind.</p>
