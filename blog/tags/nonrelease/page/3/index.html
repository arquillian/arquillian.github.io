              <h3>The short version</h3>
              <p>Arquillian now has <a href="/guides">guides</a>! If you want to know how to get started with Arquillian, head over to <a href="http://arquillian.org">arquillian.org</a> to check them out&#8230;in one of 8 languages! If you want to make them better, fork the <a href="https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian.github.com">website project</a> and get involved.</p>
              <h3>The slightly longer version</h3>
              <p>When I thought of how to present arquillian.org, naturally images of alien spacecraft came to mind. These days, there&#8217;s a lot of activity flowing in an out of the Arquillian mothership. To manage and make sense of all that information, we were in need of a central view of everything. In other words, we needed to get to &#8220;the bridge&#8221; of the ship. From there we can monitor activity, publish the lastest information, collect and exchange ideas and decide which actions to take.</p>
              <p>Well, we&#8217;ve made it, finally. Welcome to <a href="http://arquillian.org">arquillian.org</a>. As Bob McWhirter likes to say, &#8220;You&#8217;re soaking in it.&#8221;</p>
              <h3>The full story</h3>
              <p>We&#8217;ve been thrilled to witness the impact Arquillian has made over these last two years and the agility it&#8217;s brought to the Java ecosystem. There&#8217;s no question, the Arquillian invasion is in full force.</p>
              <p>But even as we stood on stage at JavaOne to <a href="/blog/2011/10/02/arquillian-wins-a-duke-choice-award">receive a Duke&#8217;s Choice Award</a> for Arquillian on behalf of our awesome community, I kept thinking about how much more successful it could be. I mean, if developers have been able to figure out how to use and build on Arquillian so far, just imagine how many more developers would use it&#8212;and how much easier it would be for them&#8212;if the project <em>actually</em> had some decent guides to get started.</p>
              <p><em>We felt your pain. We heard your voice.</em></p>
              <p>That&#8217;s why we decided at JavaOne it was time to get serious about closing this gap by writing several step-by-step guides. We didn&#8217;t leave off there, though. We recognized the whole experience of discovering Arquillian for the first time (or coming back to it after a break) needs to be extremely easy and rewarding. So after we drafted the guides, we molded them into a visually appealing website with a call to action button you can&#8217;t possibly miss. We then called on our noble community members to volunteer to translate those guides into as many languages as possible. And they came through!</p>
              <h4>The long road</h4>
              <p>Ever since then, we have been trying to get these guides into your hands. It&#8217;s been a long and rather ridiculous journey. I describe it as ridiculous for contrasting reasons.</p>
              <p>On one hand, the reason we couldn&#8217;t make it available was ridiculous. But that&#8217;s a long and boring story. On a positive note, it was ridiculous to see how much effort the community has contributed to driving this vision to make Arquillian easy to adopt and use&#8212;<em>to a website that wasn&#8217;t even being published, no less</em>. It certainly demonstrated a lot of spirit. That&#8217;s why we kept pressing against that first ridiculous reason to get it launched :)</p>
              <h4>The final stretch</h4>
              <p>Over the past several weeks, I&#8217;ve been working with Sarah and Aslak (with blood, sweat and tears) to get this website ready to publish. We have curated as much information as we can find&#8212;at least so far&#8212;and organized it into a website that&#8217;s going to give you a view into the Arquillian project like you&#8217;ve never seen before. Heck, even while building the website, I was stunned to finally see a list of modules, releases and changelogs in one place for the first time. And now, it&#8217;s finally out there.</p>
              <h4>A new beginning</h4>
              <p>This is just the beginning. By no means do I consider the website to be set in stone for you just to look at (though I need a few days off to sleep). Quite the opposite. arquillian.org is an open book. It&#8217;s a Creative Commons (CC BY-SA 3.0) open source project hosted on, you guessed it, github. Clone (or fork) the repository named <a href="https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian.github.com">arquillian.github.com</a> and checkout the <a href="https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian.github.com/#readme">README</a>. The project comes complete with an <a href="https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian.github.com/issues">issue tracker</a> and <a href="https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian.github.com/wiki">wiki</a>.</p>
              <p>It&#8217;s important to recognize that the website needs to be a part of the Arquillian project just like any other module. After all, the project is only as good as the information we put out there. I&#8217;m envisioning have contributors that join the website team much the same as they might join a module. The group will be a cross section of design, outreach, messaging, documentation and, of course, automation.</p>
              <p>We got it spun up (nearly writing it twice) because we knew Arquillian was severely lacking in good documentation and reference material, but we want you to be as involved in it as you like.</p>
              <p>The website reflects the quality of the software&#8212;especially in the eyes of new users&#8212;and therefore it represents <em>all of our work</em>. That&#8217;s why my favorite page on the site is the <a href="/community/contributors/">list of contributors</a> ;) It&#8217;s all about you, the nobles.</p>
              <h3>What&#8217;s inside</h3>
              <p>Before I close, I want to mention some key highlights of the website. Then, I&#8217;ll leave you to explore and discover the rest :)</p>
              <ul>
              	<li>All content managed in git and hosted on Github</li>
              	<li>Baked with <a href="http://awestruct.org">Awestruct</a>, a static site generator</li>
              	<li>A data curating pipeline written in Ruby (JRuby) as Awestruct extensions</li>
              	<li>Pages written in Haml (with a mix of Textile)</li>
              	<li>Easy to read, step-by-step guides (written in Textile, changelog retrieved via git)</li>
              	<li>Blogs written in Textile (or Markdown)</li>
              	<li>Guest blogs and improvements integrated via pull requests</li>
              	<li>Layout and components built on Twitter Bootstrap and jQuery</li>

              	<li>Under the watchful eye of Ike (as you can see in the upper-left hand corner)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>If you are curious about more details, check out the <a href="https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian.github.com/wiki/Information-Architecture">Information Architecture</a> page I drafted on the wiki about the site. Take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian.github.com">README</a> if you want to build the site locally.</p>
              <h3>The vision</h3>
              <p>Our vision is to automate as much as the documentation as we can possibly accomplish. It ain&#8217;t (just) because we&#8217;re lazy. It&#8217;s because we know it&#8217;s the only way to get you the most accurate, up to date information about Arquillian and to reasonably manage the growing Arquillian ecosystem. In other words, we need to be in &#8220;the bridge&#8221;. And now we have it. Just check out the <a href="/modules/">module pages</a>. What a start!</p>
              <p><em>Use it. Enjoy it. Pass it on. And fork it if you want it to be better.</em></p>
              <h3>If words could do</h3>
              <p>I want to give a huge thanks to Sarah White, who has stuck with me through trying times to get this website looking visually stunning, organized and logical (and for just putting up with my intense focus on this project).</p>
              <p>I also want to recognize the following translators, who have brought the guides to 8 languages in total: Markus Eisele (German), Antoine Sabot-Durand and Badr El Houari (French), Takayuki Konishi (Japanese), Hantsy Bai (Simplified Chinese), Bartosz Majsak (Polish), Jose Rodolfo Freitas (Portuguese) and Tommy Tynja (Swedish). Arquillian is forever changed because of your effort.</p>
              <p>Finally, I want to thank all of the contributors who have embraced writing release blog entries&#8212;Vineet Reynolds, Bartosz Majsak, Karel Piwko and Lukas Fryc&#8212;and contributing guides&#8212;Karel Piwko, Paul Bakker, Lincoln Baxter and Marek Schmidt.</p>
              <p>That&#8217;s exactly the participation I envision will make this website a key communication hub of the Arquillian project. Let&#8217;s keep the invasion strong!</p>

              <h3>Goodbye, Ajocado</h3>
              <p>Wait, the Ajocado project is not leaving us!<br />
              It is just undergoing rename.<br />
              <em>Why such a change?</em></p>
              <p>Ajocado has always been a proud member of <strong>Arquillian</strong> family, however its name didn&#8217;t tell very well what&#8217;s its purpose is in the true alien world. In other words, the name didn&#8217;t fit the story.</p>
              <p>Moreover, we have experienced many troubles explaining how Ajocado should be even pronounced.</p>
              <p>I must admit it was unlucky choice.</p>
              <h3>Choosing the new name&#8230;</h3>
              <p>The project is like a diamond &#8211; very strong in its basis:</p>
              <ul>
              	<li>a strongly-typed, chaining API</li>
              	<li>efficient jQuery-based locators</li>
              	<li>proven to handle AJAX successfully</li>
              </ul>
              <p>But on the other hand, diamonds can&#8217;t be simply manufactured.</p>
              <p>Let&#8217;s look what more could Ajocado offer us:</p>
              <ul>
              	<li>rapid test development</li>
              	<li>readability</li>
              	<li>high-level abstractions</li>
              </ul>
              <p>What can be as strong as diamond, but be much more flexible?</p>
              <h3>Welcome, Graphene</h3>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Graphene is stronger and stiffer than diamond, yet can be stretched by a quarter of its length, like rubber.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Let me introduce the Graphene &#8211; the <strong>strong</strong> and <strong>flexible UI</strong> automation tool &#8211; the old/new member of the alien crew, on the way to save the world!</p>
              <h3>What&#8217;s next?</h3>
              <p>The rename is already done, waiting in Maven repositories as Graphene 1.0.0.CR3.</p>
              <p>And what about migration? It&#8217;s pretty straight-forward, as you can see in my <a href="/blog/2012/03/15/arquillian-graphene-1-0-0-CR3">previous post</a>.</p>
              <p>Thank you all who participated in choosing new name, renaming and migration testing (Vlasta Elias, Dan Allen, Jan Papousek, Karel Piwko)!</p>

              <p>According to ohloh, Arquillian has a very large, active development team. Here&#8217;s a summary of the <a href="http://ohloh.com/p/Arquillian">contributor stats that ohloh curated</a>.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Over the past twelve months, 43 developers contributed new code to Arquillian.</p>

              <p>Thank you all for making this project so successful and fun! Arquillian has a bright future. Above all other awards and recognitions, it&#8217;s the number and diversity of contributors that&#8217;s the most significant. The smartest one amongst us is all of us, working together.</p>
              <p>Cheers!</p>

              <p>It was quite a busy fall touring around presenting our ideas, having meetings and hooking up with our awesome community. It&#8217;s time to give the ones we missed a little insight into what&#8217;s been going on.</p>
              <h3><a href="http://jz11.java.no">JavaZone</a> &#8211; Olso &#8211; Sep 7-8</h3>
              <p><img src="/images/blog/falltour2011/javazone.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 247px;" class="pull-right" alt="" /> The first event this fall was near and dear to me, not only was it in my home town but also my first public presentation in Oslo. <a href="https://community.jboss.org/people/alrubinger">Andrew</a> and I had great fun presenting at <a href="http://jz11.java.no">JavaZone</a>, and I must say, JavaZone is probably one of the most well organized conferences I&#8217;ve ever been to. Just to give a tip to other conference organizers out there; A single baguette is not food for a warrior. And when it&#8217;s served in a 1 hour time frame to 1.500 people it tends to create queues. But not at JavaZone, where they had 7 sponsored &#8216;restaurants&#8217; open all day, serving everything from sushi to traditional Norwegian elk stew. That&#8217;s the way to do it!</p>
              <p><img src="/images/blog/falltour2011/pigroast.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 354px;" class="pull-left" alt="" /> JavaZone started a few years back with something they call Journey-Zone: A trip for the speakers after the conference. This year the target was the MIT Fab-Lab near Tromsø in north of Norway. We headed up there on Thursday afternoon and headed back on Sunday. Hiking in the mountains, fishing in the fjords and hacking was a refreshing combination. The MIT Lab had a laser printer. Which to be honest, took most of our attention. Anything with a flat&#8217;ish surface got branded that weekend: ipads, iphones, androids, lenovos, rocks, etc. You name it, they branded it. Rumors had it they only let us play with the laser printer in hopes we wouldn&#8217;t discover their hidden Hadron Collider.</p>
              <p>The presentation can be seen on Vimeo, <a href="http://vimeo.com/28783382">Testable Enterprise Development with Arquillian</a>.</p>
              <h3>JBoss Face2Face &#8211; Toronto Sep 12-19</h3>
              <p>Next morning I headed of to Toronto Canada for a face2face meeting with the JBoss &#8216;Seam&#8217; team. &#8216;Seam&#8217; team being the Seam + Richfaces + Forge + Tools + Errai developers pluss qa. We spent a week on a little island outside of Toronto in a old school building.</p>
              <p><img src="/images/blog/falltour2011/toronto.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 133px;" class="pull-left" alt="" /> The general theme being: Ignore all current technical constraints. How would we want X to work? &#8230;.. then, go make it so&#8230; :)</p>
              <p>Being that all colleagues that I interact with on a day to day basis are located in a different parts of the world, it&#8217;s always fun to come together at conferences or team meeting to meet them face 2 face. Some even for the first time.</p>
              <p>On Thursday during the Toronto week we had arranged a JBoss BOF at the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/torontojava">Toronto JUG</a>. Nice group of people showed up!</p>
              <p>During the Toronto week we released: <a href="/2011/09/14/arquillian-core-1-0-0-CR5">Arquillian Core 1.0.0.CR5</a>.</p>
              <h3><a href="http://www.oracle.com/javaone/index.html">JavaOne</a> &#8211; San Francisco &#8211; Oct 1-10</h3>
              <p><img src="/images/blog/falltour2011/nobhillview.jpg" style="width: 200px; height: 374px;" class="pull-right" alt="" /> After many weeks of hectic preparation the time was upon us, <a href="http://www.oracle.com/javaone/index.html">JavaOne</a>. About 11 of us rented two huge apartments to camp for the week. Having a apartment with your colleagues compared to having individual hotels rooms, made this a completely different experience. Much more fun! Making food in our own kitchen, hacking all night&#8230;</p>
              <p>We had a brand new talk in our deck, The Extendable Enterprise Test Framework &#8211; The Arquillian SPI talk. It still needed some tweaking before presenting, so hell broke loose just before hell really broke loose. <a href="https://community.jboss.org/people/dan.j.allen">Dan</a> and I had about 6 hours of sleep the weekend before the conference started and it didn&#8217;t really get much better during the conference. Tough week.</p>
              <p>But, on Sunday 2. October, my birthday, JavaOne kicked of with the Duke Choice Awards. We made all aliens around the universe proud when Arquillian won the Duke Choice Awards for &#8220;Most Innovative Integration Testing Software&#8221; of 2011.</p>
              <p><img src="/images/blog/falltour2011/dukeschoiceaward.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 200px;" class="pull-left" alt="" /> We had our new &#8220;The Extendable Exterprise TestFramwork&#8221; session on Monday and the main Arquillian event &#8220;Real Java Enterprise Testing&#8221; on Tuesday. <a href="https://community.jboss.org/people/alrubinger">Andrew</a> joined in on the Tuesday session which was great fun. Probably the most exiting talk we&#8217;ve had so far. Good engaged audience. When we were about to leave the room after the talk, the security/door lady came over to thank us for a good session. She was so exited. In her own words (as I remember them: &#8220;There has been a lot of good talks in this room, but this one was the best I&#8217;ve ever seen! 3 young handsome energetic guys on stage, had the audience in your hands from the first second. I was out here trying to find more room in the back for more people.&#8221;</p>
              <p><img src="/images/blog/falltour2011/rockstaraward.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 200px;" class="pull-left" alt="" /> The audience spoke up and based on their feedback we got named <a href="http://www.oracle.com/javaone/quick-links/rock-star/2011-rock-stars-1453436.html">JavaOne 2011 Rock Stars</a>. Thank you!</p>
              <p>(Last year Dan and Andrew&#8217;s became <a href="http://www.oracle.com/javaone/quick-links/rock-star/2010-rock-stars-425094.html">JavaOne 2010 Rock Stars</a> for their Arquillian presentation, making it two years in a row! We&#8217;re aiming for a hat trick.)</p>
              <p><img src="/images/blog/falltour2011/shotglasses.jpg" style="width:300px; height: 208px;" class="pull-right" alt="" /> Wednesday was the JBoss party, where Arquillian again was center stage. After sliding down to the bar at Slide you were met by a ocean of Rocking Ike&#8217;s!</p>
              <p>One of the talks from the JBoss Booth mini theater can be found at Vimeo, <a href="http://vimeo.com/30749383">High Octane Development</a>. The rest should appear on parleys.com soon.</p>
              <h3><a href="http://gotocon.com/aarhus-2011">Goto</a> &#8211; Århus Danmark &#8211; Oct 11-12</h3>
              <p>The plan was to come more or less directly from San Fransisco to Århus Danmark for <a href="http://gotocon.com/aarhus-2011">Goto</a>, but it became a bit more then less due to Airline mess. We came from San Fransisco and landed in Frankfurt on Monday evening. The United flight was already delayed out of San Fransisco, so we missed our connecting flight to Oslo. And the next flight was full, and so was the next one after that. We ended up having to spend the night in Frankfurt at the airport hotel. The next morning we got tickets to Oslo, but at that point there was no longer a point in going to Oslo since I needed to be in Århus that very same day. With luck I got Lufthansa to rebook my flight to Copenhagen instead.</p>
              <p>I finally ended up in Århus at about 9 pm the 11. I call the hotel to verify my booking, for then to head directly down town to meet some of the new Red Hat Danmark people. After some time, I headed out to the hotel to find that they had overbooked and had no room for me. Back and forth, a few hours later I was in bed at a different hotel, roughly 2 am. <strong>sigh</strong></p>
              <p>To a small audience I pulled up the last energy I had and presented, High Octane Development: JBoss AS 7 with Arquillian. All in all considering I had a cold from San Fransisco, not to bad&#8230; :)</p>
              <h3><a href="http://www.jboss.org/events/JUDCon/2011/london">JUDCon</a> &#8211; London &#8211; Oct 30-Nov 1</h3>
              <p>The 4th <a href="http://www.jboss.org/events/JUDCon/2011/london">JUDCon</a> was held in London, United Kingdom. We kicked of JUDCon with the Arquillian Extensions talk, being the first talk of the day, to a filled room of exited developers.</p>
              <p>As always, this was great opportunity to meet up with the community. We ran into long time ShrinkWrap and Arquillian contributor David D&#8217;Alto for the first time. Always nice to see the face behind the cartoon character.</p>
              <p>I had to cut JUDCon short to head over to Moscow and invade the old iron curtain.</p>
              <h3><a href="http://www.secr.ru/lang/en-en/home/secr2011">CEE SECR</a> &#8211; Moscow &#8211; Nov 1-4</h3>
              <p><img src="/images/blog/falltour2011/ship.jpg" style="width: 200px; height: 500px;" class="pull-right" alt="" /> At this point my passport was getting a bit too warn, so the airport crew in Stokholm didn&#8217;t let me pass boarding without a little discussion that ended in: Let&#8217;s give it a try! We can always fly him back.</p>
              <p>Well, the Russian immigration lady was not impressed with my passport at all. After studying it multiple times and discussing with colleagues back and forth, I was let through after being given the evil eye and a clear message: Change passports!</p>
              <p>Conclusion: You can get quite far with just a smile and puppy eyes. :)</p>
              <p>This being the first time in Russia, it was quite fun riding around on the Metro in the morning trying to find the conference when you can&#8217;t tell the difference between a station name and a exit sign! But the Moscow Metro is really impressive, a massive deep underground art gallery. Even though I was lost, it was all in all quite a nice morning being that this was where I ended up:</p>
              <p><img src="/images/blog/falltour2011/kremlin.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 341px;" class="pull-left" alt="" /> I personally didn&#8217;t get much out of the sessions since most of them were in Russian. And as we know from previous experience, Russian is not my strong side.</p>
              <p>I have to send out a sorry to the audience at my session which had the pleasure of experiencing my worst talk to date! Due to technical issues (HDMI only projectors? first conference ever!) I had to improvise last minute and do a demo less session on a Russian language windows 7 laptop over a flaky conference network. It could have gone smoother to say the least.</p>
              <p>On the bright side, we did manage to release Arquillian Weblogic support during the conference. Thank you, <a href="https://community.jboss.org/people/vineet.reynolds">Vineet Reynolds</a>, for the contribution!</p>
              <h3><a href="http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV11/Home">Devoxx</a> &#8211; Antwerpen &#8211; Nov 15-18</h3>
              <p>Then off to the last stop of the this years tour, Devoxx! <a href="http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV11/Home">Devoxx</a> being one of the largest European Java conference, with massive cinema session rooms and thousands of people, we were up for a fun week.</p>
              <p>During a Hackfest we had a long chat with John Ferguson Smart, the creator of Thucydides. <a href="http://thucydides.wakaleo.com">Thucydides</a> is a reporting tool for ATDD based on Selenium. The outcome boils down to: He wants to focus on reporting and not so much runtime, while we focus on runtime and leave reporting to others. A match made in heaven. More to come on this later.</p>
              <p>We had the pleasure of meeting <a href="https://community.jboss.org/people/bmajsak">Bartosz Majsak</a>, another long Arquillian/ShrinkWrap support, for the first time. The combination of sleep deprivation and Belgium beer seemed to do wonders with our creativity. The later in the week, the odder the idea. It&#8217;s going to be fun implementing some of this in the upcoming months.</p>
              <p>During the week we found the time to do the first release of: Arquillian Extension Persistence 1.0.0.Alpha1. Thank you, <a href="https://community.jboss.org/people/bmajsak">Bartosz Majsak</a>, for the contribution!</p>
              <p>You can see the recorded version of the <a href="http://www.parleys.com/#st=5&amp;id=2809&amp;sl=0">Arquillian Extensions talk</a> on parleys.com.</p>
              <p>&#8217;til next time&#8230;</p>

              <p>Mark the date, October 2, 2011: Arquillian wins a <a href="http://www.java.com/en/dukeschoice">Duke&#8217;s Choice Award</a> for Innovative Integration Testing at <a href="http://www.oracle.com/javaone">JavaOne 2011</a>!</p>

              <p>Is there a better way to start of a though week then to get a solid acknowledgement for the hardwork that you have already put in? I can&#8217;t think of any&#8230;</p>
              <p><img src="/images/blog/dukes_choice_award_2011_team.jpg" alt="" /></p>
              <p><em>Members of the Arquillian team receiving the Duke&#8217;s Choice Award (Andrew Lee Rubinger, Dan Allen and Aslak Knutsen).</em></p>
              <p>We accept this award as an ongoing challenge to innovate. We&#8217;ll continue our mission to explore strange new testing gaps, seek out new integration points and boldly go where no integration testing software has gone before. This award goes out to the entire Arquillian community: coders, bloggers and evangelists. Excellent work!</p>
              <p>After receiving the award, we were invited as guests on the Java Spotlight podcast, which was recorded on site at JavaOne, to talk about Arquillian. You can find our interview at 11:02 into <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/javaspotlight/entry/java_spotlight_episode_51_live">Episode 51</a> in the series.</p>
              <p>We&#8217;d also like to congratulate the other Duke&#8217;s Choice Award winners as well: dooApp, Inductive Automation, jHome, JFrog, JRebel, LMAX, Rockwell Automation and one of our own, Netty. Great work! Duke certainly made some great choices this year.</p>
