This is the first release of a new Arquillian Extension for assisting in the complex task of testing portlets in a portal environment.

h3(highlights). Some of the highlights in this release

- <i class="icon-star"></i> Portal URL resource :=
The SPI provides @PortalURLProvider@ for portal specific implementations to provide a different URL when injecting a @@ArquillianResource@ of type @URL@ into a test. All that is required to use it is add @@PortalURL@ onto the injection point, it's that simple.
- <i class="icon-star"></i> Additional portal deployments "=
The SPI provides @PortalContainerDeploymentProvider@ for portal specific implementations to provide additional deployments that are required by the container to initiate the portal.

Currently there are two implementations of this extension for use with "Pluto":https://github.com/jbossportletbridge/pluto-testing and "GateIn":https://github.com/jbossportletbridge/gatein-testing portal containers.

For examples on how to use these extensions with their respective portal containers, you can take a look at the "testsuite":https://github.com/jbossportletbridge/jbossportletbridge/tree/master/testsuites of JBoss Portlet Bridge.

We look forward to hearing your feedback about this release in the "community forums":#{site.project_space}!
