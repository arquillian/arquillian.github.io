The third and hopefully the last Alpha release of Drone 2.1.0 significantly improves the resolution of binaries from GitHub.

h2. GitHub release caching

In the Drone "2.1.0.Alpha1":/blog/2017/01/26/arquillian-extension-drone-2-1-0-Alpha1/ we introduced a new feature of automatic downloading for webdriver binaries which is really cool, but had one drawback. The Gecko driver is stored in GitHub so Drone has to send some request to get the latest version and to download the required binary. Unfortunately, GitHub has for unauthenticated requests a "rate limit":https://developer.github.com/v3/#rate-limiting that allows us to make up to 60 requests per hour, which wasn't hard to exceed (for example in CI servers).

In this release, we solved this problem using conditional requests so it should be impossible to run out of the number of limited requests now.

There is nothing that you would need to do to activate this feature, just update your Drone dependency and use your Drone tests as you did.

We hope that you'll enjoy our new stuff and look forward to hearing your feedback.
