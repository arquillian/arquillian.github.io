!(graphic pull-right)/images/blog/drone_400.png! We've introduced new features and bugfixes in 1.2.0.Alpha1 while still preserving backwards compatibility with 1.1.0.Final. We fixed an annoying bug that made usage of some capabilities impossible and have delivered some Firefox goodies.

h3(highlights). Significant changes since 1.1.0.Final 

- <i class="icon-star"></i> Updated Selenium to 2.28.0 and introduced Selenium BOM :=
Now you can switch to next Selenium version only by including following snippet in your pom.xml file.

div(filename). pom.xml

bc(prettify).. <dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <groupId>org.jboss.arquillian.selenium</groupId>
        <artifactId>selenium-bom</artifactId>
        <version>${version.selenium}</version>
        <type>pom</type>
        <scope>import</scope>
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement> =:

p(warning). %This snippet must go above arquillian-drone-bom in order to override Selenium versions.% 

- <i class="icon-star"></i> Support for loading XPI into Firefox profile :=
There is no need to work with a separate Firefox profile. Simply use WebDriver generated one and let Drone install all extensions you need.

div(filename). arquillian.xml

bc(prettify).. <extension qualifier="webdriver">
    <property name="browserCapabilities">firefox</property>
    <property name="firefoxExtensions">/path/to/extension1 "/path/to extension2/with/space"</property>
</extension> =:

- <i class="icon-star"></i> Ability to set WebDriver logging level :=
Drone allows to to set logging level for Firefox WebDriver directly from Arquillian configuration.

div(filename). arquillian.xml

bc(prettify).. <extension qualifier="webdriver">
    <property name="browserCapabilities">firefox</property>
    <property name="loggingPrefs">driver=INFO,profiler=WARNING</property>
</extension> =:

p(info). %Logging level are the same as for JUL, that is SEVERE, WARNING, INFO, CONFIG, FINE, FINER and FINEST.% 


I'd like to thank everybody involved in this release. _You guys make testing a breeze!_
 
We hope that you'll enjoy the improvements. We look forward to hear your feedback in the "community forums":#{site.project_space}.
