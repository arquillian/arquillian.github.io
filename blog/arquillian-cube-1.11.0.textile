p. We are delighted to announce a new version of Arquillian Cube 1.11.0. This release brings integration with another project from Arquillian universe as well as few bug fixes.

h3. What's new

p. <i class="icon-star"></i> **Integration between Graphene and OpenShift**

p. We have created an integration between "Arquillian Graphene":http://arquillian.org/arquillian-graphene/ and Arquillian Cube OpenShift.

p. Now, if you are using Arquillian Graphene (in "standalone mode":http://arquillian.org/arquillian-graphene/#arquillian-mode-options) together with Arquillian Cube OpenShift, the base URI of Graphene is automatically set to the URL specified in OpenShift @Route@.

p. You can configure a specific @URL@ using the @url@ property from @graphene@ configuration. In this case, the hostname is going to be resolved as OpenShift @route@ name, and if there is no @route@ with that name, then @URL@ is treated as is. For example:

bc(prettify).. <extension qualifier="graphene">
  <property name="url">http://hello-world:8080</property>
</extension>

In the previous example, this integration will try to find an OpenShift @route@ with name @hello-world@ and inject its IP. If there is no @route@ with that name, then the @url@ field is considered to be the final @URL@.

p. You can see full example at "Graphene example":https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian-cube/tree/master/openshift/ftest-openshift-graphene

p. Many thanks to "Ioannis Canellos":https://github.com/iocanel for his help.
