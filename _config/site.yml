title: Arquillian
tagline: Write Real Tests
definition: "Arquillian is open source software that empowers you to test JVM-based applications more effectively. Created to defend the software galaxy from bugs, Arquillian brings your test to the runtime so you can focus on testing your application's behavior rather than managing the runtime. Using Arquillian, you can develop a comprehensive suite of tests from the convenience of your IDE and run them in any IDE, build tool or continuous integration environment."
description: An innovative testing platform for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Open source. Highly extensible.
descriptions:
  bom: The Arquillian Universe BOM is a 'Bill of Material' Maven POM file collection that make up a module stack that stretch across the whole Arquillian Universe.
  shrinkwrap: ShrinkWrap is the simplest way to create archives in Java.  Using the fluent and intuitive ShrinkWrap API, developers may assemble JARs, WARs, and EARs to be deployed directly by Arquillian during testing.
  osgi: ShrinkWrap is the simplest way to create archives in Java.  Using the fluent and intuitive ShrinkWrap API, developers may assemble JARs, WARs, and EARs to be deployed directly by Arquillian during testing.
  resolver: The ShrinkWrap Resolvers project provides a Java API to obtain artifacts from a repository system. This is handy to include third party libraries available in any Maven repository in your test archive. ShrinkWrap Resolvers additionally allow you to reuse all the configuration you've already specified in the Maven build file, making packaging of an application archive much easier job.
  descriptors: The Shrinkwrap Descriptor project provides an uniformed fluent API for creating and modifying Java EE deployment descriptors on the fly. Starting from the very early JEE 1.3 to the brand new Java EE 7 version, the descriptor project includes almost all official deployment descriptors. Several vendor specific deployment descriptors, mostly JBoss related, are covered as well.
  docker: The Shrinkwrap Descriptor project provides an uniformed fluent API for creating and modifying Java EE deployment descriptors on the fly. Starting from the very early JEE 1.3 to the brand new Java EE 7 version, the descriptor project includes almost all official deployment descriptors. Several vendor specific deployment descriptors, mostly JBoss related, are covered as well.
  cube: With Arquillian Cube you can control the lifecycle of Docker images as part of the test lifecyle, either automatically or manually. This gives you the chance to scale up from a integration/functional test level all the way up to the system test level.
  chameleon: The Chameleon container can quickly adapt to your needs of testing against several containers (JBoss AS / JBoss EAP / WildFly / GlassFish) or even switching between different modes (Managed / Remote / Embedded) without requiring additional dependency configuration.
  testing: Smart Testing is a tool that speeds up the test running phase by reordering test execution plan to increase a probability of fail-fast execution and thus give you faster feedback about your projectâ€™s health.
